"USDA Partners with Service Organizations to Help Veterans Find Careers","Veterans returning home from overseas tours-of-duty face many challenges as they readjust to civilian life, and one of the most daunting ones is finding employment. Last year, a new program  the Soldiers to Civilians (S2C) Project  was started in rural west Tennessee to give local veterans the training and skills they need to enter into the field of precision agriculture. Thanks to grant assistance from the Department of Agriculture (USDA), project leaders will now be able to expand the S2C program beyond west Tennessee to help even more veterans living in the rural delta areas of east Arkansas and west Mississippi.
The expansion was funded, in part, through USDAs Rural Business Enterprise Grant (RBEG) program, which promotes development of small and emerging businesses in rural areas. Rural Business-Cooperative Service Administrator Lillian Salerno announced the award during a visit to the Memphis Bioworks Foundation, a bioscience-oriented nonprofit organization that is a partner on the S2C project. Memphis Bioworks is one of more than 130 projects in 30 states and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico that are receiving RBEG funds.
The S2C project to train veterans for precision agriculture jobs was the idea of Tennessees Crockett Policy Institute. Memphis Bioworks has teamed with the Institute on the S2C project and it is receiving a USDA grant that will enable S2C to expand into 110 counties.
Precision agriculture uses sophisticated equipment like GPS, satellite imagery and other computer technology to help farmers manage their crops. Veterans are excellent candidates for this type of work because their military training exposes them to similar technology systems. Today, veterans are computer-savvy and used to operating very advanced systems, noted Bill Stubblefield, director of Memphis Bioworks AgBioworks Regional Initiative, at the event.
According to Salerno, the RBEG program finances a broad range of business projects. Since the beginning of the Obama Administration, the RBEG program has helped create or save more than 73,000 rural jobs, provided over $170.9 million in economic development assistance, improved manufacturing capability, and expanded health care and educational facilities, and has either expanded or helped establish almost 41,070 rural businesses and community projects.

Owner Greg Rice has taken G&M Associates from a small construction and engineering service provider to a full-service design and build contractor that provides services for the commercial, institutional and governmental sectors. He credits the MBDA Business Center in Jackson, Mississippi, with playing a significant role in that growth.
Headquartered in Tennessee, G&M sought counsel on extending into new markets.  The Jackson MBDA provided assistance in identifying contracts, strategic bidding and marketing. As a result, G&M Associates was awarded a $14 million contract from Gulf Coast Housing to build a multi-family, commercial and retail facility in a New Orleans neighborhood that had been hit hard by Hurricane Katrina. The project includes retail space on the ground floor, topped by two floors of affordable housing. The contract created 120 new jobs and attracted workers from the surrounding states.
""Working with MBDA has been a phenomenal experience. Their experts seem to really have the pulse of the city and the state. They know about both the local and the federal jobs that are out there. And they have helped us get some really big contracts and expand our business. Their services resulted in a $14 million revenue stream which otherwise would not have been available to G & M Associates. Greg Rice, Principal and Owner

"Sambazon: Making Trees in the Rainforest ""Too Valuable to Cut Down""","Site: Brazilian Rainforest 
Sector: Agriculture, food
Challenge: Sambazon, a small and growing U.S. business needed financing for an overseas project to develop a sustainable way to build a more reliable supply of aai berries.
Solution: An OPIC loan financed construction of an environmentally-sustainable, organic aai-berry processing facility.
Impact: Processing facility creates income for 10,000 family farmers in the rainforest. Sambazon more than doubles its U.S. employee base.
Sambazon Inc. of San Clemente, Calif. was formed in the year 2000 when a couple of friends traveling in Brazil noticed the local popularity of the antioxidant-rich aai berry and saw an opportunity to introduce it into the U.S. They started by purchasing a container of frozen pulp and peddling it to juice bars in southern California, but as sales took off in retail stores around the United States, they began to look into more reliable and efficient ways to collect and process the aai berries, which grow in the wild in the Brazilian Rainforest.
In 2006, Sambazons Brazilian subsidiary, Aai do Amapa Agroindustrial, obtained a $3.7 million loan from OPIC for the construction of an environmentally-sustainable, organic aai-berry processing facility. The Company saw the plant not only as a way to introduce sustainable industry into the rainforest, but also to secure a stable supply for its growing U.S. business.
As a small business without a lot of assets, we were challenged in the world of credit. And obtaining financing was even harder for an overseas project recalls Sambazon CEO, Ryan Black, who co-founded the business with his brother Jeremy. OPIC not only provided the fixed asset financing we needed and also gave us the flexibility to grow our working capital as our business required. As an agricultural company with an annual crop period, this was immensely helpful to our success.
Company's U.S. staff doubles. The business has grown steadily, providing income for 10,000 small family farmers who harvest the aai berries in the rainforest. Every year, we continue to certify more and more farmers in fair trade and organic farming, says Black, who once described the companys mission as to use aai as a vehicle to promote sustainable development in the Amazon by making the trees too valuable to cut down.
In the U.S., the companys aai juice drinks are now available in grocery stores and restaurants across the country. That explosive demand has also contributed to increased employment in the U.S. Since it began building its processing facility in the rainforest, Sambazon has more than doubled its U.S. employee base, to about 60.
Sambazon won the 2006 Award for Corporate Excellence, the ACE award for its work with indigenous populations in the Brazilian Amazon.

" Kelleys Country Creamery Receives  Value-Added Producer Grant award","The national early morning show, Good Morning America (GMA) wanted to know what Americas favorite thing about summer is, so they asked viewers and the overwhelming response was getting ice cream with family and friends.  As a result, GMA decided to find and showcase Americas Best Ice Cream.
A favorite place for many Wisconsin residents is Kelleys Country Creamery located in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. The business was one of three ice cream shops selected and featured as Americas Best Ice Cream on the ABC early morning talk show, Good Morning America. Kelleys Country Creamery is a 150-year-old family dairy and farmstead operated by Karen and Tim Kelley, and their children  Amie, Betsy, Heidi, Molly, and Clark. The family operates a 200-acre farmstead dairy and tend the 65 Holsteins that provide the milk for the Creamery. 
In 2008, Karen and Tim Kelley received a Value-Added Producer Grant from USDA Rural Development to conduct a feasibility study on the production and marketing of their familys homemade ice cream and for the development of a business plan of an onsite creamery.  Three years later, Kelleys Country Creamery was open for business.  The company later received a second Value-Added Producer Grant award that provided them with additional working capital, which allowed them to sell ice cream to local markets and restaurants.

"Community Rallies to Save its Historic Theater","The Scenic Theater in Lisbon, North Dakota, like many small-town theaters, was struggling with the high cost to convert from a film to digital format. Film had been an industry standard for more than a hundred years, but Hollywood studios will stop printing on actual film by the end of the year.
Established in 1911, the Scenic is the oldest, continually operating theater in the United States. Due to the digital upgrade, theater owners, Al and Betty Michels, were worried that it would be forced to go dark for the first time. To make the transition, all new equipment would have to be purchased and installed, which would cost close to $100,000. With this daunting number, the community rallied to help preserve the historic theater.
A group of seven local residents organized the Save Our Scenic (S.O.S.) campaign in April. In three months, they raised over $74,000. Donations came in from folks in 15 different states and over 300 local donors. All ages were involved in the fundraising efforts which included: a second grader selling eggs, donated babysitting money, barbecues, and an Elvis impersonator show.
Receiving over 30 letters of support, USDA Rural Development helped the campaign reach its goal by awarding the City of Lisbon a Rural Business Enterprise Grant - http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/BCP_rbeg.html. The equipment was then purchased by the City of Lisbon who will lease it at a nominal fee to the theater owners.
Being 70 miles from the next closest theater, the Lisbon area certainly would have lost an entertainment focal point and a core business, said Jasper Schneider, USDA Rural Development state director. The communitys support and generosity really saved the Scenic.

" Rural Developments Business & Industry Loan Guarantee Helps  Maryland Company","True Chesapeake Oyster Company has found what the company believes is the perfect place to grow an oyster. St. Jerome Creek, located near the midpoint of the Chesapeake Bay, is the nursery grounds for their not-too-salty, not-too-sweet oyster. The company was launched in 2010 and since then has grown by leaps and bounds. Its clean, crisp oyster, called the Skinny Dipper, was introduced at Pimlico Racecourse during the running of the 138th Preakness Stakes, where some 11,000 oysters were shucked and served.
USDA first communicated with The Patapsco Bank in Baltimore in March to explain how Rural Developments Business & Industry loan guarantee program (http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/BCP_gar.html) could help the bank and its business clients. As a result of the conversation, True Chesapeake Oyster Company secured a loan, guaranteed by USDA, to support shoreline restoration and repair an existing pier at its oyster growing operation in St. Jerome Creek.  The company sells oysters in Washington, D.C., Baltimore and in Annapolis.
USDA Rural Development has increased its marketing efforts to promote the Business & Industry Loan Guarantee Program by meeting with top executives and loan officers at financial institutions throughout the state.
According to USDA Rural Development Acting Under Secretary Doug OBrien, In todays environment, economic recovery is the driving factor in everything we do, and our support for this local food project will have many benefits, OBrien said. It will help support jobs and businesses in the region and support an eco-friendly environment that helps restore and protect the Chesapeake Bay.

"USDA Promoting Strategic Regional Economic Opportunities","Memphis, Tennessee is emerging as a metro region where rural and urban economic opportunities suggest the need for meaningful collaborative activities. Recently, USDA staff participated in a gathering of community development workshop in Memphis where rural leaders gathered to share challenges and successes with urban counterparts. The event was sponsored by the National Association of Development Organizations (NADO), the Delta Regional Authority, and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Developments (HUD) Office of Sustainable Housing and Communities.
Beginning in 2010, HUD began providing three-year Regional Planning grants to groups that were interested in developing long-range community plans that would help guide future federal investments in a more strategic manner. A number of those grants have been provided to communities in the Mississippi Delta region, and last weeks meeting gave the Delta Region grantees a chance to share successes and challenges of their efforts.
One of the panels paired the East Arkansas Planning and Development District with the Shelby County Government effort providing them with an opportunity to explain the progress they are making with their Regional Planning grant.  One of the ongoing challenges will be for these rural and urban communities to determine how their future prosperity hinges on strategies that link rural and urban citizens.
Another purpose of the meeting was aimed at bringing philanthropic foundations to the table so they could learn more about federal grantees work and explore ways in which they could complement these planning efforts. In addition to Delta Region community foundations, staff from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation attended, demonstrating their foundations enduring interest in the Mississippi Delta region.
A topic of particular interest to rural foundations was a discussion of capacity building opportunities associated with the inter-generational wealth transfer in rural areas.  Mary Hinde of the Community Foundation of Northwest Missouri shared with the audience that since Secretary of Agriculture keynoted at the foundations inaugural meeting in January 2011 the foundation has established endowment funds of nearly $15 million, providing growing capacity to serve an18 county rural area of Missouri.
Also participating was staff from the White Houses Stronger Cities Stronger Communities (SC2) multi-agency initiative aimed at providing targeted federal technical assistance to some of the nations most economically challenged cities.  USDA is working with SC2 via our Strike Force Initiative to collaborate with partners such as Heifer International to support efforts that will support rural farmers in providing locally grown and healthy food to urban populations in the Memphis region.
Finally, we heard about another USDA initiativeStronger Economies Together (SET)  from Bo Beaulieu of Purdue Universitys Center for Regional Economic Development.  SET enables rural places to work together in developing and implementing economic development blueprints for multi-county regions. This exciting initiative was launched in 2010 and will have served 60-plus regions in 28 states by the end of 2013.
Regional strategic planning is essential for USDAs community development and public infrastructure programs to be implemented effectively.  Hopefully, meetings like this one will give participants a few more tools to ensure success at developing modern economic strategies and in creating rural places where the future generations want to live and work.

"USDA Grant Fund Helps Expand Businesses and Create Jobs in South Dakota","Last fall, South Dakota USDA Rural Development highlighted a valuable partner; GROW South Dakota, formerly known as the Northeast South Dakota Economic Corporation, for its 18 year partnership in community lending.  While giving back to the communities they serve, GROW South Dakota has also contributed to the region as a whole through its fiscal administrative support of regional planning and development through a Rural Business Enterprise Grant (RBEG)  and a  Rural Business Opportunity Grant (RBOG).
 The total impact that GROW has had is not just measured in loans made or jobs created; they have assisted in the stabilization and creation of thriving, vibrant communities in rural South Dakota, said South Dakota State Director Elsie Meeks.  Small businesses use U.S. Department of Agriculture funds to develop and provide web-based technical assistance for the regions partnering organizations and for a regional website that provides a central link to local organizations and expertise for the current technology and available social media.
By providing industry information, community data, commercial real estate information, and quality of life information, the northeast South Dakota region collectively markets through the South Dakota Prairie Gateway website.   This regional approach to a website and social media incorporates regional collaboration and shared values while generating benefits and marketing for the people and businesses of our region, said Lori Finnesand, Chief Executive Officer for GROW South Dakota.
By August 2012, the nonprofit economic development corporation received and implemented 10 Intermediary Relending Program (IRP) loans that helped affected twenty-eight different communities, ninety-eight businesses, and leveraged $15.6 million in total financial support for start-up and expanding businesses.
And the success continues.
Capitalizing on the regions readiness to work together, those same communities have continued partnering. Sharing their success with the region, GROW South Dakota has provided USDA leveraged funds to further sustain the businesses in their service area as well as support the success of the region for a sustainable future.

"USDA Helps  Fund Alaskas First Member-Owned Community Grocery Store","Alaskas first member-owned community grocery store is open for business thanks in part to a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Economic Development Loans and Grants (REDLG) that helped fund the Fairbanks Community Cooperative Market.
Golden Valley Electric Association (GVEA), a USDA borrower since 1949, made project possible.  GVEA received a REDLG to fund a revolving loan, which it used to help establish the market.  USDA Rural Development Alaska State Director Jim Nordlund traveled to Fairbanks, Alaska last month to join with community, volunteers, and founders in the grand opening of the new Market.  The store has already provided more than 20 new local jobs for residents.
We couldnt be more pleased and proud of the longtime partnership weve had with GVEA, said Nordlund.  This is the first time Alaska has received REDLG funding in more than 10 years and we couldnt be more excited for the business owners, volunteers, and residents in celebration of their new, local marketplace.  The project complements USDAs Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food initiative by strengthening the connection between farmers and consumers and supporting local and regional food systems.
The market will provide opportunities for Alaska farmers and ranchers to promote their locally and regionally produced food and expand access to affordable fresh and local food.  Additionally, its educational efforts should cultivate healthy eating habits and educated, empowered consumers.
Our collaborative success today couldnt be complete without the strength and determination of the staff and volunteers at the Fairbanks Community Cooperative Market, Alaskas first food cooperative, and we want to make sure they receive credit for their teamwork in this effort, said Mary Christensen, General Manager of the Co-op Market Grocery & Deli.  The goal of the new marketplace is to emphasize Alaska-grown and made foods as much as possible.
With more than 1,500 followers on Facebook and spotlights from local media, residents quickly discovered the new Co-op as a place where you can find freshly prepared soups, sandwiches, salads, local meats, and Alaskan seafood that are local produce and much more.
We cant stress how important it is that Alaska builds its agriculture and food security programs and its the successful partnership between USDA and local business that will go a long way to encourage this industry and bolster community and economic growth, and provide new jobs in the Fairbanks area, said Nordlund.  We hope that other electric and telecommunications companies in Alaska will be inspired to follow suit and work with Rural Development to establish similar success stories in their own communities.

In visiting this facility, the State Director reflected on the future of this and other facilities and their importance as the Nation anticipate the droves of baby boomers seeking to maintain a quality of life as they transition to assisted-living.
The U.S. Department of Agricultures (USDA) Business and Industry Guarantee Loan program financed the facility with a $4.5 million loan guarantee to Pinnacle National Bank of Nashville.  The loan guaranteed gave the owners an opportunity to create a beautiful facility for the residents.
Facilities like Daisy Hill are going to be especially important, as the demand for elder care facilities increase with the aging of our baby boomer generation.  Kentucky has seen an increase in the last decade of nearly 45 percent in the boomers who reached the age of 55-64  this is according to the 2010 U.S. Census.  Their share of the state total population rose from 9.2 percent to 12.4 percent according to the Kentucky State Data Center.
This dramatic increase is only the first wave of becoming of age for the baby boomer generation.  An anticipated second wave of boomers may be even more dramatic, making the demand for assisted living facilities like Daisy Hill continue the upward trend over the next decade.
While the primary focus of assisted living facilities is about providing residents and families with quality services.  There is an equally important secondary focus, and that is to bring opportunities for economic development and jobs to the community.
The jobs created by the opening of the Daisy Hill facility are just the beginning of job creation opportunities for Versailles and surrounding communities.  New opportunities for local businesses to provide products and services will also bring greater economic growth to the community  and will result in the creation of even more local jobs.
USDA Rural Development is multi-faceted in what funding programs it offers.  In addition to providing financing for facilities like Daisy Hill, we can work with businesses and economic development organizations to help them secure financing for a variety of business development purposes.

Since the purchase, this employee-owned foundry has consistently shown increases in sales beyond anyones wildest dreams.  The foundry now employs 40 full and part-time employees.  Since taking over, the new ownership has increased annual revenue during the first four years by 105 percent and during the past four years (spanning The Great Recession) has increased revenue by another 50 percent.  The growth has come from both existing and new accounts.  Dakota Foundry has doubled its customer base and expanded the regions it serves.  Its two largest customers are Hub City Inc., a major Aberdeen company that makes gear drives and other items, and Gehl, a nationally known maker of farm and other equipment, with a factory in Madison, South Dakota.
The relationship with Hub City is a prime example of how area towns are not economic islands unto themselves, said Doug Valsvig, the foundrys Executive Vice President.  Whats good for Aberdeen is good for us, and whats good for us is good for Aberdeen, he said.
Dacotah Bank, along with the City of Webster and the Northeast South Dakota Economic Corporation (NESDEC) who are recipients of USDA Rural Development Intermediary Relending Program funding, provided the rest of the financing to purchase the business.
The transformation at the individual level was important.  Its rare to have a chance to have some ownership and control your destiny, said Valsvig.

In Troy, North Carolina, USDA Rural Development had the opportunity to highlight our successful efforts with a local company Aseptia/Wright Foods.
Lillian Salerno, Acting Administrator for U.S. Department of Agricultures (USDA) Rural Business-Cooperative Service, visited the local business.  Under USDA Rural Development, in 2012, USDA guaranteed a $5.5 million loan for Aseptia to purchase a building, equipment and make building improvements for their first commercial-scale manufacturing facility.
The owners formed the company so it could compete in the food manufacturing business as a provider of aseptic packaging.  As result of the high demand for their product, the company created two additional equipment lines as part of the start-up of the facility.  Aseptia/Wright Foods has doubled initial hiring projections, employing nearly 80 workers.
As a result of the investments made by USDA and our financing partners, good paying jobs are being created and saved and our rural economy is being strengthened, said Salerno.  USDA is working with communities across North Carolina to create new opportunities.
The companys main products consist of fruit or snack type products that are packaged with a shelf life of up to one year.  With their technology, they are able to sterilize the food product without preservatives and in a manner than maintains more flavor and nutrients.  The company is also working as a co-packer for large well-established brands in the food industry.

"SBTDC: Enterprising Family Finds Fertile Entrepreneurial Ground in Springfield, MO","If it hadn't been for Katrina  the hurricane that devastated New Orleans and southern Mississippi three years ago  Mike and Charlotte Dawley would be operating a successful collection agency in Slidell, La., today.
Instead Louisiana's loss is Missouri's gain, Springfield, Mo., to be exact.
It was to that thriving southwest Missouri town the Dawleys traveled in the wake of the August 2005 super storm that literally redesigned the Crescent City and the adjacent area.
The Dawleys had purchased an acre of land on Aug 18, 2005, to build a 3,000-square-foot facility in Slidell for the business they'd been planning for more than a year. Katrina drastically altered their dreams after it made landfall 11 days later.
Mike and Charlotte lost all their possessions. Their newly built home in Pass Christian, Miss., not far from Slidell, was swept away. So too was the vision of starting their own company in the area.
What they retained was years of management experience, Mike as an employment director and operator of a construction business, Charlotte as a manager with more than a decade of experience in the collections industry specializing in start-up operations and salvaging struggling sales offices.
After the storm the Dawleys decided to pull up their few remaining stakes to find a new market for their dreams. Springfield became their new goal.
""We were very familiar with Springfield and we felt it would be a perfect market to start our business,"" recalls Mike.
With the support offered by many Springfield businesses and community leaders, the Dawleys planted the seeds of a new beginning. After establishing a new home they reinvigorated their business plans, opening Hammer Collections in April 2006.
Mike and Charlotte started the business despite the difficulty they were having in obtaining a business loan. They had submitted a business plan with their loan applications, but had been turned down by two banks.
Shortly after opening their business doors, the Dawleys received  advertising in the mail that became the key to opening the loan door.
""I received a letter from the (Missouri State University) SBTDC telling me about their services and an upcoming seminar on writing a business plan,"" Mike remembers. ""I figured I had nothing to lose by going to the seminar on business plans and could possibly learn what I was doing wrong.""
Learn he did. While attending the class Mike discovered he needed to improve his financial projections and cash flow statements. Following the seminar he met with the instructor  Rayanna Anderson, director of the MSU SBTDC who gave him specific advice on those two elements.
""After I made the changes to my business plan, Rayanna encouraged me to approach one of the banks that had previously turned me down,"" says Mike. ""This time my business plan was complete and the bank approved my loan.
""Rayanna won't sugar coat the message to her clients. She knows the difficulty involved with meeting the requirements of banking formulas and policies and she makes it clear to her students and clients what is needed for them to obtain their goals.""
Getting the loan gave Mike and Charlotte the boost they needed for their company. From the first year in business to the second year their revenue and sales grew 500 percent. Since then it's progressed at a more manageable, yet vigorous, 40 percent. In another sign of progress, they've secured a loan from The Bank of Missouri and started construction on their own building. 
Hammer Collections has clients nationwide. The Dawleys can help any company with delinquent commercial accounts.
""Our goals are simple,"" says Mike. ""To get as much debt placed with our agency for collections and then to collect as much of it to generate revenue and get our clients paid back the money they are rightfully owed.""
According to Mike, with the establishment of Hammer Collections in Springfield, they have essentially brought a new industry to the area.
""We are training newcomers to the business,"" he explains. ""We have to hire, train and try out many people before we find the employees who are the right fit. Another challenge is that running this business, or any business, requires complete attention to all details, which sometimes can be draining.""
But while Mike and Charlotte take care of those details, they know they've got a resource they can rely on for business advice:
""Rayanna and the SBTDC were a huge help in the early stages of our business start up, and on occasion I still reach out to them with questions. I know that they are always there for me if I need assistance.""

After earning his doctorate in diagnostic medicine and veterinary pathobiology at Kansas State University, he came to MU to conduct bacterial disease research. One of Brian's side projects at MU lead to a discovery of a new way of producing enzymes. Collaborating with veteran MU scientists  George Stewart, chairman and professor of veterinary pathology, and Chung-Ho Lin, research associate professor of agroforestry  Brian perfected new enzyme production processes that are being patented by the University.
(Note: MU's intellectual property policy is similar to most research universities: when University researchers develop a patentable product or process, it becomes the property of the institution.)
Soon after Brian left MU to form his company, he signed a licensing agreement with the University allowing Elemental Enzymes to use the patent-pending processes he developed during his stint as a postdoctoral researcher.
That licensing agreement was one of many steps in the business start-up process. Brian took another significant step when he contacted the Small Business Technology & Development Center at MU's College of Engineering.
After completing several key business classes taught by staff of the SBTDC Brian engaged the help of Paul Bateson, business counselor and tech commercialization specialist at the center, for assistance in setting up his company. Bateson encouraged the business novice to become fully educated about his key markets, helped with investor advice and connected Brian to many useful resources and potential future clients. Additionally, Bateson assisted Elemental Enzymes in submitting several federal SBIR grant applications to pursue additional start-up capital.
""It's a great feeling to realize after more than a year of hard work we've arrived at the point where production and testing can take off,"" says Brian. ""However, I know without Paul's guidance and the additional help we received from the SBTDC, we would not be a company today.""
Brian originally called his enterprise Spogen Biotech Inc. But several people, including Bateson, strongly encouraged Brian to devise a more recognizable and easier to pronounce name. Hence, the moniker Elemental Enzymes was born.
Bateson also helped Brian analyze and secure sources of start-up funding. The company attracted funds from several private investors. That amount doubled this summer when the firm received approval of its application to the TechLaunch co-investment program at the Missouri Technology Corporation, part of the state's Department of Economic Development.
""Having this backing has allowed us to buy research equipment and lease excellent lab space at the MU Life Science Business Incubator at Monsanto Place,"" says Katie, whose research specialty is molecular, cellular and developmental biology. ""Now that we're moved into our new lab we'll be able to take larger strides and make more research progress that will lead to additional product lines in the near future.""
Chief among those strides is building products that meet the needs of potential clients. Two recently developed enzyme applications with direct market potential: lactase, an enzyme that breaks down sugars, for use by researchers; and lipase, an enzyme that breaks down oils and fats for bio-fuel applications.
""It's a great feeling to realize after more than a year of hard work we've arrived at the point where production and testing can take off,"" says Brian. ""However, I know without Paul's guidance and the additional help we received from the SBTDC, we would not be a company today.""

"SBTDC: Missouri S&T Engineering Grad finds his Future Lies in Entrepreneurism","Imagine you've just graduated from school. Imagine you and your fellow grads have left the comfy confines of hallowed academia to face the real world of rising unemployment, declining personal income and a fearful economic wilderness.
That's the exact situation David Pollack found in May 2008. The native of El Dorado Springs, Mo., had just completed his B.S. in mechanical engineering at the Missouri University of Science and Technology in Rolla.
After taking a couple of well-deserved months to refresh himself from the study grind, David interviewed with a Florida engineering firm. His prospective boss offered a six-month assignment to transfer all the company's files from its old computer system to a new one. Sixty hours a week for six straight months of nothing but data entry. David passed on this mind-numbing duty.
Next, he interviewed with a Kansas engineering firm. The biggest part of the interview included loading a truck ... not usually an element of a typical job interview. David saw the writing on the wall and realized this opportunity also was not for him.
Soon after this second less-than-stellar offer David experienced an entrepreneurial revelation. From the earliest time David could remember, his father Stuart Pollack constantly talked about the challenges facing the energy industry: the limits of finite resources, the need for conservation and the prospects for alternative sources of energy. Also, after four years of study in Rolla, David had formed a solid network of colleagues and friends, many of whom were also in the same professional position  looking for work.
So, his revelation involved starting an energy-related business in Rolla. His goal for the firm, Cornerstone Energy Solutions LLC, is to focus on energy efficiency in residential, commercial and industrial settings.
""Before we as a nation look seriously to alternative forms of energy, we as consumers of energy need to first take the steps necessary to conserve energy by taking the time and effort to tackle the day-to-day problems associated with wasted energy,"" says David. ""My company is designed to help our clients discover those energy conserving steps and put them into practice.""
David and his staff at Cornerstone currently offer three avenues devoted to energy conservation. Their on-site services focus on analysis of a client's home or business. The analysis leads to recommendations for improving the energy efficiency of the structure.
Their training services  currently the firm's most lucrative focus  are designed to equip prospective energy analysis professionals with the skills they need. Cornerstone offers formal classes around the state for individuals, community action agencies, contractors and others. The sessions are offered through educational partnerships with universities, community colleges and vocational-technical institutions. Classes cover such areas as weatherization practices for technicians, OSHA construction safety, lead-safe worker practices and a BPI (Building Performance Institute Inc.) building analyst course for energy auditor certification.
The third revenue-generating focus of the company is its recent development of a do-it-yourself custom energy-saving kit. It offers several energy saving items in one handy container customized for the home. Included are materials to insulate a hot water heater, window and door gaskets and sealers, and faucet adapters and shower heads to conserve water flow.
""We're always looking for new ways to help clients improve energy efficiency,"" says David. ""Our chief technician, Gary Chaney, has a lot of training and experience in the field. He's always looking for new ways to improve our services and the results for our clients.""
Back in September 2008, when David's entrepreneurial ambitions blossomed, he needed two things: certified technical training in residential and commercial energy analysis and some capital to purchase necessary equipment. He found the technical training from the Tri-County Construction Labor Management Council in Peoria, Ill. This gave David the foundation necessary to successfully complete his BPI certification.
David needed another kind of training for raising the capital. To get the $4,500 equipment loan from a commercial lender he needed a business plan. To develop the business plan, he needed help. David found that help from Mick Gilliam, Small Business and Technology Development Center business specialist based at the Phelps County MU Extension SBTDC in Rolla.
""Mick gave me the steady, experienced hand I needed to take the steps to establish my business,"" recalls David. ""I had the technical expertise to design and conduct the work of my business. I just didn't have the business knowledge I needed to get it off the ground and keep it running. Mick guided me expertly.""
With the business plan in order, David obtained the needed equipment loan. Mick also helped the young engineer understand other critical financial, management and accounting elements necessary to run a business from day-to-day and week-to-week.
Cornerstone has been in operation since January 2009. It's making money, providing jobs and paying off the loan. It's doing so well, David is looking to the future, with the thought of franchising his business model.
""I have an appointment to talk to Mick about it next week,"" reports David. ""I want to take my business to another level, so I'm planning to learn a lot more from his wealth of business know-how.""

"SBTDC: Broyles Transfer and Storage Kirksville, MO.","Jacob Condon, co-owner of Broyles Transfer and Storage in Kirksville, didn't follow a conventional path to business success. He didn't earn an MBA. In fact, his major wasn't in business but in English from Truman State University in Kirksville, earned in 2005.
Condon's most recent professional experience wasn't with a local banker or CPA, either, but one of the largest and most geographically dispersed entities in the world. Jacob Condon recently returned from Qatar, an oil-rich emirate on the Persian Gulf, where he served as a first lieutenant with the 175th Military Police Battalion, providing critical site security, convoy escort missions, transportation and other duties on U.S. military bases.
And the road less taken doesn't stop there. Condon didn't stick close to his home in Minnesota to start a business. Before he and his wife, Heather, bought Broyles Transfer and Storage, he was working in Ottumwa, Iowa, commuting 65 miles one way each day. They agreed that was too far and began looking for something closer to Kirksville.
Heather, a Truman State University psychology major and realtor with the Century 21 Whitney Agency in Kirksville (who also does bookkeeping for the transfer and storage business), knew that Broyles was on the market. The couple approached the owner, who agreed to sell. They in turn agreed to keep the firm's name.
""The Broyles name had good recognition and a good reputation,"" says Condon. The firm was established in 1959. ""Plus if we changed the name of the company, we'd have to spend more money on advertising.""
As with most young couples, money was an issue. The now-engaged couple managed to purchase the business with funds partially raised from friends and their families.
""We figured if we could be business partners, then marriage would be easy,"" he says. But following the wedding, with his deployments and a brand-new daughter, that wasn't exactly the case, either.
The family loans put them in business but they weren't enough to truly grow the company. They needed to secure a loan and to do that, they needed advice and counsel about the legal structure of the firm, a sound business plan, and a thorough financial review.
The couple had previously been introduced to staff at the Truman State University SBTDC. The SBTDC counselors were happy to help, poring over the company's financials, helping them whip a business plan into shape and then guiding them through the process of securing an SBA guaranteed loan. The result: Broyles Transfer and Storage increased revenues to more than $135,000 last year and is on track to do as well or better this year, Condon says, despite a soft economy. The firm also employs more than double the number of employees the previous owner employed, mostly veterans.
The SBTDC helped the Condons hammer out a realistic plan based on information from the previous owner and helped the new owners develop an improved marketing plan. The Condons' success is mainly due to their hard work and hiring dependable, hard-working veterans doesn't hurt, either.
The couple's commitment to hiring active duty, reserve or veteran military personnel is so strong Gov. Jay Nixon chose Broyles Transfer and Storage as the location at which he signed House Bill 1680 in July 2012. This bill strengthens and expands the Show-Me Heroes program, which provides businesses incentives to hire military veterans and spouses.
Under the new legislation, employers would be reimbursed for 50 percent of a veteran worker's wages during training. The bill also provides financial assistance to spouses for payment of overdue bills, transportation, daycare and vocational counseling.
""To be able to offer them that [employment], to say 'We understand you're going to be gone for training, we understand you'll be gone for drills  that's just part of their life and duty to our country. We owe it to them to offer them jobs,"" Heather says.
Condon says the area's relative isolation and two schools make it ideal for a small business like his, which also provides students storage in a two-story, elevator-equipped facility. Kirksville is roughly three hours from Des Moines, St. Louis or Kansas City. In addition to Truman State, it is home to A.T. Still University.
""We are kind of isolated up here. The national economy affects us, sure. But we mainly do local business."" Condon says he's moved people as far away as Maine, returning with empty trucks. Unlike nationwide movers who can pick up return or nearby business, helping recoup fuel, meals and lodging costs, he has to build one-way trips into his bids. But he manages to remain competitive.
""Plus we're a local business, a family business, and people know and respect that,"" he says. Moving can be traumatic, so dealing with people you know can go a very long way.
And the future? ""I have another year left of my obligation to the Guard,"" he says. ""Then I'll probably get out. I have a wife and daughter now.""

"SBTDC: Motorcycle Enthusiasts Team Up to Transform Their Avocation into Serious Business","Motorcycles are in the blood of Chris Azdell, Richie Nowlin and Shayne Belshe and they know from experience that when something is in their blood, they've just got to run with it.
That's what led them to start their own custom motorcycle repair and service shop  Brick City Custom Works  in 2004, in Mexico, Mo.
""My partners and I decided many years ago that we wanted to expand our knowledge of our own bikes and eventually do our own repairs and maintenance,"" says Azdell. ""After years of riding, and wanting a new career, we decided to pack up shop in late 2000 and move to Phoenix, Ariz.""
There they enrolled in the Motorcycle Mechanics Institute, the only mechanics school endorsed by the Harley-Davidson Motor Co., the iconic Milwaukee-based motorcycle producer. All three specialized in Harley-Davidson service, repair and performance for early model, late model, V-rod and Buell motorcycles.
In early 2002, the trio returned to Mid-Missouri, where the new owners of the Mid-America Harley-Davidson dealership in Columbia hired them as repair technicians. By late summer Azdell took over as service manager, Belshe became assistant manager and Nowlin served as an A-technician.
During the next couple of years all three motorcycle aficionados gained a wealth of experience in motorcycle repair and service. They also developed an itch to team up and start their own motorcycle service shop.
Three years later they decided to seriously pursue the idea of starting their own company, but they needed some guidance. Pat Nowlin, the adult education director at the Thomas H. Hart Vocational School in Mexico, Mo., suggested they contact Virgil Woolridge, University of Missouri Extension business development specialist in Audrain County.
Woolridge indoctrinated the would-be entrepreneurs about challenges of business ownership. He counseled them on how to start a business, emphasizing the information found in the Business Start-Up Kit available from the Missouri Small Business & Technology Development Centers, which is part of MU Extension's business development program.
""This business venture, as with all business start-ups, was inherently risky because the business owners were giving up existing jobs with benefits to start the business,"" Woolridge recalls.
He counseled them about the various forms of business ownership and on break-even analysis to ensure their business idea was viable. Woolridge also gave them the information necessary to legally start a business in Audrain County.
Their biggest challenge was dealing with a lack of start-up money, according to Woolridge: ""They were able to somewhat overcome this by pooling their resources and creating sweat-equity in their business.""
While operating a business for the past three years, the Brick City boys have maintained an optimistic outlook. They believe they've gained a wealth of knowledge about small business survival.
""We strive every day to please our customers,"" says Azdell. ""The smiles on people's faces when they pick up their bikes are worth every bit of hardship we face to keep the doors open.""
""We also believe we help keep the public's motorcycles in top condition to help them save money on gas, as well as reducing emissions on Mother Earth. We feel we help economically and environmentally.""

"Branson Moving Company Taps SBTDC Expertise During Business Downturn","Three years ago the moving industry faced a turning point, according to John Cheary. He should know. John owns Affordable Moving Services Inc., the National Van Lines affiliate in Branson.
The moving industry is to the economy like the canary is to the coal mine-- a precursor of things to come, says John. Demand for moving services dried up across the country in 2007, a year ahead of the national downturn in the economy.
""We could tell something was up,"" John recalls. ""Commercial moves, military moves, private moves all virtually disappeared. Business was bad. I thought we were going under.""
To determine his next move, Cheary sought advice from a long-time source of entrepreneurial guidance, the business development specialists at Missouri State University's Small Business and Technology Development Center. Rayanna Anderson, director of the center, and Isabel Eisenhauer, SBTDC consultant, listened to John's dilemma and offered alternatives for him to consider.
""They can't make decisions for me and they can't sit in my seat, but they opened up my mind and gave me additional avenues to consider,"" says John. ""Being a small business owner can be lonely. You can't confide many things with your employees or your customers or even with other small business owners, so where do you turn? I turn to the SBTDC.""
Since then John has successfully consolidated his business. He reduced expenses, moved his business to a more efficient location, and downsized his staff while maintaining cash flow and retaining the focus of his business on the customer.
""We treat this business like a ministry, helping people in need,"" says John. ""You get into people's lives. I take the approach that I'm teaching people about moving.""
Teaching is second nature to John. Before he entered the moving industry, he'd spent 26 years as a high school music teacher and band director in Tipton, Monett, Springfield and Branson, MO. John was dedicated to his students and developed an individually directed music system that he wrote and published in a six-volume textbook.
While he loved working with young people, John found his intensity and dedication took a toll on him. Retiring from teaching, he turned to a new field ... moving. Finding a new outlet for his intensity and dedication, John and his wife, Jacque, started AMS in 1996.
""Our goal is always to save the customer money. We try to educate the customer completely.""
John's approach to his clients is similar to the approach he found at the SBTDC when he first sought expert business advice shortly after starting his company.
An initial class from Anderson in profit and loss statements led to a series of consultations on the growth and development of his business. Eventually he explored other aspects of business with classes from the SBTDC in marketing, accounting and finance.
While the economy boomed, the moving industry thrived. So did Affordable Moving Services. But 2007 came and the moving business came to a near halt. It was then John met with the SBTDC to discuss alternatives.
""We covered many topics, from how to keep from going bankrupt to what to do if we did go bankrupt, and everything in between,"" he recalls. ""With Isabel's help we found a way to keep going. The joy for us is providing for the customers and my employees ... and I can bring my dog to work!""

"SBTDC: For Missouri Business, Chocolate Brings Sweet Success","If chocolate is the way to a woman's heart, Alan Patric McClure thinks that the path to love should be a little more refined.
McClure is the brains behind Patric Chocolate, a mid-Missouri business experiment that brought the gospel of better sweets to mouths across the U.S. and small business success to the community.
""Don't think of what we do as chocolate in the way you are familiar with chocolate, but rather think about it as something like coffee, something like craft beer, something entirely different,"" McClure said. ""It's something where a lot of care is put into it, where quality is of foremost importance to us.""
That commitment to a better chocolate bar transformed his business from a one-man operation into one that sold a quarter of a million dollars worth of chocolate in 2011, doubling his sales from 2010.
The University of Missouri Small Business & Technology Development Center (SBTDC) helped McClure build a business framework, set realistic goals, and make accurate financial projections.
""When Alan came to our center and I started working with him he knew about chocolate, but he didn't know much about business,"" said Virginia Wilson, a counselor with MU Extension's SBTDC. ""We help small businesses like Patric Chocolate with one-to-one counseling, take them through the process of writing a business plan, look at the financial start-up costs, and estimate sales and expense projections to decide whether a business can be profitable.""
When McClure began the business in 2006, he started with just an idea.
Fresh out of college, the religious studies major knew he was interested in food and in particular, chocolate. Two years spent in France after college exposed the Kansas City native to the art, flavors and variations that chocolate could offer to a person's palate.
""I never had French chocolate, never had a lot of their brands, and when I was able to try them in France it really opened my eyes. I was tasting flavors I never tasted, trying to figure out why they were there. After doing more research I realized it was the quality of the cacao beans they were buying,"" McClure said. ""Those beans have all those flavors inherent in them based on the variety of the cacao and also the post-harvest processing which includes fermentation, important in flavor development in all sorts of foods like wine, beer, cheese, bread.""
After he returned to the U.S., he was hooked on the concept, and spent much of his first year perfecting his process. Wilson helped McClure refine his business plan using financial tools to develop realistic goals that took operational costs and cash flow into account. This work helped Patric Chocolate secure loans to get the business up and running.
""I did get loans because she told me how to get my financials in line in a form that would be decipherable by people at a bank,"" McClure said. ""SBTDC really helped me through some tight spots to make my business as successful as it could be.""
In many ways, the secret to Patric Chocolate is in the bean.
McClure didn't want just any cacao bean  the base for all chocolate  for his sweets. He traveled abroad not only to find sources for the high-quality tropical crop, but also to identify family-owned farms that paid a fair wage for his supply. He sources his beans from places like Venezuela, Madagascar, Papua New Guinea and Ghana, keying into the regional flavor that come from climate and soil differences
Patric Chocolate doesn't mask those beans with excessive ingredients, but rather keeps it simple, with the primary ingredients in his chocolate bars being refined cacao and sugar. His seven employees sort those beans from 150 pound bags before roasting, separating them from their shells and grinding them into different coarseness levels, called nibs.
By mixing nibs with sugar, grinding the mix into a finer powder and conching  intense, heated mixing  his employees prepare the chocolate mix to be aged, tempered and molded into bars stamped with the Patric logo.
""What is so difficult about that? It's a people business. I don't simply survive ... I thrive. But it's not about the money. Once my business account was down to $300 and my entire staff had quit. I worked my tail off and the business continued.""
Now Patric produces 10 varieties of chocolate bars that sell online and in more than 40 local stores including Clovers, Hy-Vee, Root Cellar and World Harvest in Columbia.
Patric Chocolate has garnered national recognition, starting with being named ""Best New American Chocolate"" in 2010 by Food and Wine Magazine. Buzz from Forbes Magazine and national Good Food Awards in 2011 and 2012 followed. His bars now sell to consumers in 49 states and internationally.
McClure isn't the only small business reaping the benefits of MU Extension's help.
The University of Missouri's Business Development Program helped generate $2.4 billion in economic impact from 2009-2011. It helped clients increase sales by $885 million, gain $978 million in government contracts and create or retain 35,008 jobs.
""It helps locally, helps the community, helps the state create jobs and you've got investments,"" said Wilson, ""so we all benefit from businesses not only starting, but remaining successful.""
Local business success means more jobs and money in the economy. McClure estimates that sales in 2012 will double, and if that happens Patric Chocolate will expand and hire more employees in 2013.
""In the beginning, these rooms were pretty much empty and now they are filled with chocolate from wall to wall,"" McClure said. ""Our sales have continued to grow, almost doubling this past year and we are on track to double this next year.
""Considering that my first year of sales in 2007 was only $12,000, it seems impressive.""

"SBTDC: Specialty Glass Producer on Technological Cutting Edge","Many long-term diabetes patients face the prospect of dealing with chronic ulcerated wounds of the lower extremities. These venous stasis wounds, as they are labeled in the medical world, can linger for several years. For a diabetic these chronic wounds can start with something as innocuous as bruising a shin on the edge of a coffee table. Unhealed they can lead to declining health, amputation and ultimately death.
A specialty-glass manufacturer in Rolla, MO  MO-SCI Corporation  believes it has developed a product that can offer a simple treatment leading to rapid healing of such wounds. This cotton candy-like glass fiber material is called DermaFuse.
Currently DermaFuse is in a pre-clinical trial at the Phelps County Regional Medical Center in Rolla and in animal testing at the University of Illinois in Chicago. While it awaits an extensive barrage of testing before it can receive FDA approval for treating humans. 
The boron-based bioactive glass has been licensed by a Baltimore firm for marketing to the veterinary medicine field. MO-SCI retains the licensing for the human-wound application of the product.
Invented by Missouri University of Science & Technology (MS&T) ceramic researchers, Steve Jung and Delbert Day, DermaFuse is one of the latest developments in a long line of products from the 27-year-old MO-SCI Corporation. MO-SCI has been a client of the Small Business & Technology Development Center (SBTDC) at MS&T since 2004. The company is a world leader in the research, development and manufacture of specialty application glass.
One of its first products was a miniscule glass bead named TheraSphere. With a diameter of 15 to 35 microns  about one-quarter the width of a human hair  a radiated version of the product can be used in liver cancer treatments. MS&T ceramics Professor Delbert Day and University of Missouri Research Reactor scientist Gary Ehrhardt developed the bead therapy in the early 1980s.
Day founded MO-SCI in 1985, because no supplier within the glass industry was willing to make TheraSphere, according to Ted Day, president of MO-SCI and son of the professor.
""Dad thought there might be other companies that had a similar need to acquire niche glass materials,"" says Ted. ""MO-SCI was started with that concept in mind and after 27 years  serving more than 2,000 customers and exporting to 50 countries  I think he was right.""
During the first few years MO-SCI operated on a slender thread, like most new small businesses. In MO-SCI's case that slender thread had a name: SBIR (Small Business Innovative Research) awards, which are limited-amount research and development (R&D) grants available for promising research efforts of interest to any of a variety of federal agencies.
MO-SCI researchers began writing SBIR proposals soon after start-up. Within four years they had received three Phase I awards ($100,000 each) and a Phase II award (up to $750,000 each).
""For the first five years, we lived on the research dollar,"" recalls Ted.
But in addition to SBIRs, two other factors led to the firm's progression. One was its ability to level the playing field among much larger companies by structuring MO-SCI to take advantage of the personnel and assets available through MS&T. The firm also assembled a business plan that combined all aspects of the services its customers needed, Ted says.
""These were R&D, analytical, pilot, and full-scale production and post-forming services. No other small specialty glass manufacturer that we know of has done this.""
Today MO-SCI serves 85 percent of Fortune 500 companies. It also serves the majority of the top 50 on that list as the sole supplier for their specialty glass products. Through its three divisions  MO-SCI Corporation; MO-SCI Health Care, LLC; and MO-SCI Specialty Products, LLC  it offers such products as microspheres, powders and continuous glass fibers for applications in aerospace, automotive and electronics in addition to the medical, pharmaceutical and other industries.
As an example, Ted cites his firm's work with health care giant Johnson & Johnson: ""J&J came to us in the late 1980s and asked if we could develop a glass microsphere that would be inert in human blood, while also being of very high quality and of a narrow size distribution.""
MO-SCI soon began producing the microspheres to J&J's specs. Today MO-SCI is J&J's only supplier of the minute glass orbs and ships tons per month, which the New Jersey-based medical product manufacturer uses for blood typing cards in hematology labs.
""We stay in the glass and ceramics world,"" says Ted. ""When somebody comes to us with a need, if we don't have it, we develop it. And we tell potential customers upfront, 'If your primary driver is low cost, we're probably not the company to come to.' The cost of quality can be high.
Of the company's 40 employees today (it had 10 when Ted joined the firm as president in 1998) most are in R&D. The others work in production and administration.
""R&D work is expensive and labor-intensive. We sell peace of mind with a little product. We have never had a recall. We vigorously test our products before we release them, so we know the product will work for our customers. Quality assurance is our priority.""
Growth is the norm for MO-SCI, especially during the past 10 years. The company moved from a 16,000-square-foot facility in 2005 to its current 40,000-square-foot manufacturing and lab space.
Immediate plans call for an 80,000-square-foot addition to the current building within the next 12-18 months. Long term, the company president foresees construction of a separate manufacturing plant for DermaFuse, when final approval comes from the FDA for use with human patients.
Workforce stability is another consideration. Turnover is low.
""Our employees are our most important asset,"" MO-SCI's president recognizes. ""We offer long-term training and a full benefits package. Employee satisfaction is our mantra. Retention is our goal.""

"SBTDC: St. Louis Area Entrepreneur Spreads Solar Energy  Applications for a Better America","n his 2006 State of the Union address, former President George W. Bush called for a new approach to energy development: ""Keeping America competitive requires affordable energy. Here we have a serious problem: America is addicted to oil, which is often imported from unstable parts of the world. The best way to break this addiction is through technology.
""By applying the talent and technology of America, this country can dramatically improve our environment ... move beyond a petroleum-based economy ... and make our dependence on Middle Eastern oil a thing of the past.""
Among the millions of American citizens listening to the President's words that January evening was a self-employed goldsmith from the St. Louis area, Jeff Lewis.
Bush's words inspired Lewis. In a post-9/11 world Lewis found the call to energy independence patriotic, as well as challenging and entrepreneurial. He decided to apply his business experience in a new direction, founding MidAmerica Solar LLC in January 2007.
Back in the early part of his career Jeff worked for a jewelry company as a goldsmith at industry tradeshows nationwide. He traveled to virtually every state in the Union and also worked two years in the United Kingdom. At each location during his many years of travel he created new pieces for customers from their old inherited rings and other jewelry.
While traveling he teamed with a jewelry designer from St. Louis, Carrie VanSickle. Their partnership blossomed into something more than business. They married in 1998. After two years abroad the pair quit their jobs, returned to St. Louis and started their own custom jewelry business.
Jeff continued for nearly 10 years to work in his own studio doing commercial jewelry work. But by the summer of 2010, the ground work he laid for his solar energy business during the prior three years was paying off. He landed several jobs yielding $2.3 million in contract work. They included a 15.5-kilowatt solar array for a multi-unit housing project in Farmington, Mo.; a 241-kilowatt solar and 32.5-kilowatt wind energy unit divided among 32 homes and a resource center in the nation's first net-zero energy community, Lexington Farms in Jerseyville, Ill.; parking lot lighting for the city hall of Richmond Heights, a St. Louis suburb; and special application illumination for the Harry S. Truman Memorial Veterans Hospital in Columbia, Mo.
""The VA lighting project allows the hospital to display a specially designed group of 21 U.S. flags 24 hours a day,"" says Lewis. ""It involves three solar arrays, each powering seven lights  one per flag. The project is the first off-grid solar project at any government building in the nation and takes advantage of our patented Twain Technology lighting system.""
The Twain system is an off-grid electricity approach, combining wind turbine and solar panel-based innovations to generate power stored in a specialized battery. When fully charged the battery can deliver power for up to 120 hours. The special LED bulbs that provide the illumination can last more than 20 years. True to the patriotic inclinations upon which he founded his company, Lewis uses only American-made components in all his projects.
This past year has brought such demand for MAS innovations that Lewis has left his long-time custom-made jewelry career. He now devotes full time to his innovative renewable energy business. One of the factors that helped Lewis arrive at this level of entrepreneurial growth was business counseling from Phil Berger, St. Louis-based MoFAST technology commercialization specialist with the Missouri Small Business & Technology Development Centers.
""Jeff has used MoFAST and MO SBTDC services over the past year to define his operation and market thrust and as a sounding board for proposals the company is considering,"" says Berger. ""He has plans to expand, add jobs, and increase revenues and margins.""
Keys to the discussion were issues related to cash flow and inventory purchases for the manufacture and delivery of products. In addition, Berger introduced Lewis to a professional accounting firm specializing in services for startup technology businesses such as MAS.
The tech counselor also helped Lewis make connections with two groups interested in supporting early-stage tech companies: the Innovate St. Louis Venture Mentoring Service, a networking organization, and StartUp Midwest, an angel investment firm in St. Louis County.
""Phil Berger and the SBTDC have helped me focus my energy and have given me the direction I need to succeed with my entrepreneurial dream,"" says Lewis. ""I plan to build on that and do what I can with my business to help our country move forward in these demanding times.""

"SBTDC: Lawrence Fabric & Metal Structures, Inc. St. Louis, MO.","Lawrence Fabric & Metal Structures, Inc., a leader in the manufacture of awnings, canopies, tension structures, exhibit components, banners and industrial products, is responsible for some of the more notable architectural icons of St. Louis  the bright red bow wrapped around the St. Louis Science Center Planetarium during the holidays; the sleek awnings at Busch Stadium; and the bright, festive awnings of St. Louis Children's Hospital.
Just a few years ago, Lawrence wasn't sure it would be manufacturing much of anything, much less icons.
From 2007 to 2009, sales dropped 36 percent to an all-time low of $5 million in 2009, and the company was forced to lay off a substantial portion of its workforce. The company had been doing well, with 2007 sales of more than $8 million. But in the ensuing years, the recession magnified the disparity of cost from competition as the firm was heavily hit by cheap, imported awnings and industrial products sewn overseas.
So the company decided to enter the Trade Adjustment Assistance for Firms (TAAF) program, a matching U.S. Department of Commerce Economic Development Administration grant that boosts American manufacturers' ability to compete globally. TAAF, a sister initiative of the MO SBTDC, is administered by the Mid-America Trade Adjustment Assistance Center (TAAC) to help manufacturers in Missouri, Kansas and Arkansas  assistance that has resulted in millions of dollars of manufacturing production improvements and increased sales. In this case, it was TAAF project manager Rebecca Nace who stepped to the plate to assist Lawrence.
Nace and Lawrence agreed that the firm needed to respond to the flood of imports decisively and began an earnest review. Detailed consultations over a period of a few months revealed the company needed a wage analysis and should offer additional training for their workforce, particularly in a specialized software suite called CAD, which when implemented reduced cost and errors.
TAAF funds also assisted the firm with management training; additional production, marketing and sales improvements; engineering to improve products; exploring product lines less susceptible to foreign competition; and upgrading software systems.
Perhaps the most dramatic upgrade, however, was provided by another icon, Boeing.
In 2011, Boeing approached Lawrence asking if the firm could become ISO certified. Because of TAAF funding, the company responded positively and immediately began the process of becoming ISO certified. Boeing then responded with increased and larger orders, resulting in an immediate sales increase of about $1 million.
Lawrence was ISO certified at the end of 2012 and expects more orders from Boeing and other clients who require ISO certification. Currently, Lawrence has annual sales of more than $10 million, an amazing 96 percent increase in sales since participating in the TAAF program. The number of employees, which bottomed out at 37 individuals in 2009, is today 62 employees, a 68 percent increase.
Jerry Grimaud, president of Lawrence, says TAAF softened the hit of the recession and put it in a great position to compete during the recovery. Lawrence has now surpassed pre-recession sales and is looking toward another great year in 2013.
""There were many software programs available I knew would help our company survive and subsequently grow during the recession,"" says Grimaud. ""But it was very difficult to justify spending money when you are trying to tighten your belt and sales are dropping. TAAF was the catalyst that propelled me to make decisions I procrastinated about.
""Without TAAF, I would be two years behind, playing catch-up on market wages and software improvement. The supplement TAAF provided to help us attain ISO status was, without hesitation, the most substantial immediate contribution to our recent success as anything in the history of Lawrence.""

"SBTDC: Hufft Projects, LLC of Kansas City","Winston Churchill said, ""We shape our buildings, and afterwards our buildings shape us.""
And the shapes of Hufft Projects, LLC, have landed on the covers of top architectural and design magazines, museums and showrooms around the world.
Hufft Projects' clean, modern, neo-minimal private houses and commercial structures are redefining Midwestern architecture. Co-owner, CEO and architect Matthew Hufft and long-time designer friend Clayton Vogel also established Edwin Blue, a division of Hufft that designs and manufactures high-end contemporary furniture for residential and commercial use. Edwin Blue's modus operandi is handmade and modern  two words not often seen together. Edwin Blue is unique in the architectural world; very few design organizations also do component fabrication. Edwin Blue currently has representatives in Kansas City and New York.
According to their product catalog, Hufft and Vogel set out to design and build beautiful, functional and long-lasting furniture. ""Inspired by the reputation the United States once held as a nation that made things, Vogel and Hufft aspire to win that reputation back in some small measure with their collection of thoughtfully designed, handmade furniture,"" it reads.
Hufft and his wife, Jesse, plunged into the design world after attending New York's Columbia University graduate school and establishing a design firm in New York. They recognized a gap in contemporary area architecture design, and like good entrepreneurs, decided to fill that gap.
The Huffts initially received several large commissions to design contemporary, expensive homes in the Springfield and Joplin areas. One of those residential projects was for a prominent real estate developer, who then contracted with them to provide architectural design on several multi-family projects.
Projects began to flow to Hufft from around the region. Another client, the owner of a small Midwestern restaurant chain, was so pleased with the Huffts' work that he commissioned them to do a number of new restaurants.
Missouri seemed to be appreciative of their talents. After careful consideration, the Huffts decided to move to Kansas City in 2006. It was a wise move. Relocating to Kansas City triggered a rapid expansion of the design portion of the business, enough that the principals added a fabrication division and Edwin Blue.
The Huffts were introduced to the University of Missouri-Kansas City SBTDC and business counselor Mark Allen in late 2011, when he was asked by another resource partner to review the company's financials and counsel the Huffts on another relocation, renovation or building purchase.
Allen reviewed the company's financial statements and recommended that the owners hold off on any physical expansion while they strengthened the company's financial position.
""The Huffts sincerely wanted to understand their obstacles to growth and profitability,"" says Allen. ""Growth was not a problem, but profitability was not meeting their expectations. The principal service I performed for them was as a resource provider and counselor, presenting options for decision-making and information on how those options may come out.""
Allen introduced the Huffts to three lenders, one of which became their local bank. He also met with the firm's management team to redefine roles, analyze strengths and weaknesses and define the company's strategic direction and goals as well as consider options for employee ownership. He was also helpful in providing introductions to customers and suppliers.
The result of these efforts is undeniable.
From 2010-11, company revenues grew from $850,000 to $1.5 million and this year will eclipse $2 million. In that same timeframe, the company grew from 13 to 24 full-time jobs plus additional part-time help. The Hufft team is largely composed of young, vibrant designers energized by the high performance level and pace of their work, and the Huffts expect to grow even more.
Success doesn't always breed awareness, but it has in Hufft's case. Hufft realized that, as much as he enjoys designing, the firm needed a true CEO and that he was the best candidate.
As CEO, Hufft and the firm's marketing director now work on benchmarks and timelines. Hufft says he balances his management with his practitioner role, allowing him to spend more time developing new business and visions for daily living. Increasingly, he says, that vision includes green and sustainable elements.
""Sustainable design is morphing our practice at 110 miles per hour,"" he says. ""I feel like the attitude has changed from clients saying they want to be different and green to just expecting the house to be efficient.""

"SBTDC:  FINSPEED of Moberly--High-Performance Auto Parts Maker","Small businesses are a lot like families. They need a place to call home.
And so it is with FINSPEED of Moberly. The company manufactures and distributes high-performance parts and accessories for sports car owners and enthusiasts. Among the parts it makes are wheels, enclosed clutches, seats and oil coolers.
""We can serve the full range from the vintage Mustang of an amateur enthusiast to the latest Ferrari that runs at Le Mans,"" says Daniel Finke, founder and president of FINSPEED.
When they started the business in 2009 Daniel and his wife, Stacie Finke, used their home in Columbia as the headquarters for their business. Initially all parts manufacturing was contracted with a Daytona Beach, FL, firm.
However, being a small customer at the mercy of a large manufacturer wasn't satisfactory for FINSPEED. Production lead times usually dragged. Daniel soon realized he needed to bring production in-house if he was to meet his customers' needs. But his garage in Columbia wasn't the place to set up shop.
Last year the Finkes began scouting the mid-Missouri area for a home for FINSPEED. They searched all over Columbia, in Fulton and as far east as Bowling Green, in addition to many other locations in central Missouri. Finding the right spot was difficult.
As the search continued, Stacie's father, Leo Himmelberg, offered an idea. Himmelberg, a former farmer in Glasgow who is now in the banking business, suggested his daughter and son-in-law give Moberly a serious look. The banker had a couple of contacts there: Cory Mehaffy, president of the Moberly Area Economic Development Corp. (MAEDC), and Danny Lobina, director of the Small Business & Technology Development Center (SBTDC) at Moberly Area Community College (MACC).
After meeting Mehaffy, the Finkes started looking seriously at Moberly. They found a workable site in an industrial area on the south side of town. The owner of the building, Jim Roberts, offered a good lease deal. Lobina offered sound business counseling from the local SBTDC. The overall combination was irresistible to the Finkes, who formally moved their business to Moberly last July.
""They made us feel welcome,"" recalls Daniel.
Among the suggestions Lobina made was to ensure the business had an eight-to-nine-month cash reserve instead of the usual six-month cushion demanded by most lenders. After completing their loan package with Commerce Bank, the Finkes found the extra reserve helpful when equipment delays occurred. Parts for one of the machines necessary for wheel cutting arrived several months late from a foreign supplier, a victim of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in northeastern Japan.
""That was the kind of unforeseen problem Danny Lobina urged us to consider when calculating the cash reserve we would need,"" remembers Daniel. ""He sure was right.""
Today FINSPEED is making products in-house, currently focusing on producing wheels. Virtually the entire current inventory is spoken for. Product line expansion will come in the next few months as the manufacturing crew grows.
""We're finally off the ground and serving our customers across the country and around the world,"" says the company founder. ""It's been a little bit of a roller coaster ride.""
Current plans call for the plant to be at single-shift maximum production by the end of September. If all goes well, a second shift should be in full operation by January 2013.
The Moberly location is working well for FINSPEED, says Daniel: ""If the advice we received from Cory and Danny hadn't been sound, we wouldn't be here. It was good advice we could count on. Now we're making the most of it.""

"SBTDC: Northwest Missouri Manufacturer Recycles Tires in New Process for Carbon Black Production","A manufacturing revolution has arrived in northwest Missouri. Ray Riek, CEO of Carbolytic Materials Co. and his operations staff in Maryville are applying a recently developed proprietary method to produce carbon black, a substance much like graphite with a multitude of applications in everyday products.
The extraordinary manufacturing process has brought a new production plant and a couple of dozen manufacturing jobs to northwest Missouri in the past year.
Carbon black is among the 50 top industrial chemicals produced worldwide. It's used as a reactant in rubber to provide abrasion resistance. Its primary use is in the manufacture of tires. In addition it has a variety of industrial rubber applications and it acts as a tinting agent in almost every product tinged black.
Until this new manufacturing process was developed, carbon black production relied on two manufacturing methods  furnace black and thermal black  which involve incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons from primarily petroleum-based sources.
CMC's new approach to carbon black production relies on discarded tires as the raw material. The process reduces the amount of used tires going to landfills while simultaneously recovering carbon black and oil.
The resulting product  ApexCM  possesses physical properties comparable to other types of carbon black. It comes in pellet or powder form. Applications include hoses, gaskets, belts, rubber boots, roofing material, bags, plastic pipe and sheet plastic in the automotive, agriculture, construction, electronics and industrial equipment markets.
Decades of experience in chemical engineering and R&D work in product development set the stage for Riek's latest venture.
He is a 30-year veteran of product and process research and development with the St. Louis-based Monsanto Co. After leaving Monsanto in 1997, Riek worked as a product commercialization consultant. It was during this stage of his career that Ray learned of a new technology for carbon black production.
""We assembled a team of folks with experience in the industrial chemical business in late 2006,"" recalls Ray. ""We are quite proud of what has been accomplished to this point by both the management team in building the company, and the operational team in Maryville in learning to operate a new technology and produce a product that has been well accepted.""
CMC's arrival in Maryville was based on a series of factors.
""Maryville was one of several sites we were considering for our first manufacturing facility,"" says Ray. Its proximity to several urban-based sources (Kansas City, Des Moines and Omaha) of the process's raw material (shredded tires) was a major advantage.
However, a more important consideration was the interest CMC received from local agencies and institutions.
""The reception and assistance we received from the city of Maryville, Nodaway County and Northwest Missouri State University was an unbeatable combination,"" says Ray. ""Frank Veeman (director of the NWMSU Small Business and Technology Development Center) and NWMSU were involved from the beginning. Indeed, they were instigators in getting us to investigate Maryville and see what the community had to offer.""
Among the pluses were laboratory facilities at NWMSU's newly established Center for Innovation and Entreprenurship (which also serves as home to the SBTDC), a prime location on the east side of town for CMC's plant; a pool of talented and dedicated labor; and sufficient financing secured with the help of Lee Langerock, Executive Director of the Nodaway County Economic Development Council.
In the spring of 2008, Riek and NWMSU President. Dean L. Hubbard announced CMC's plan to build its first plant in Maryville and to become the first tenant of NWMSU's CIE. Later that year CMC broke ground for its plant and began production in the summer of 2009. Today the 20,000-square-foot manufacturing facility employs 25 people while processing (and recycling) 15,000 tons of shredded tires annually. The company currently produces and sells 10 million pounds of ApexCM carbon black material and two million gallons of recovered oil.
Ray says plans call for a doubling of capacity in the next 12 months at CMC's flagship facility in Maryville. The company's management team hopes to take the production model to other locations in the Midwest in the next few years.
""The University has been a great host, the county has helped connect us locally and with the state, and Frank helped make some critical introductions,"" Ray says. ""It all builds on itself.""

"SBDC Client's Childhood Vision becomes Entrepreneurial Reality ","All kids are fascinated by Fourth of July fireworks displays. About 30 years ago a certain young farm boy in Polk County was no exception to that rule.
Since then that farm boy has proved it is an exceptional individual who knows at an early age what he wants to be when he grows up ... and then follows through and becomes exactly that.
""I absolutely loved fireworks as I was growing up on my folks' farm,"" says Aaron Mayfield. ""But it wasn't just the noise and bright lights that fascinated me ... it was the artistry of the whole experience. I knew early on I wanted to make this my life's work.""
Growing up as an only child on the 200-acre farm near Pleasant Hope, Aaron was relentless in his fascination with pyrotechnics. His parents didn't quite understand his single-minded determination, but as the years passed they helped mold it in an entrepreneurial direction.
Today Aaron is the owner and operator of A.M. Pyrotechnics LLC a few miles south of Buffalo, Mo. The company, which Aaron started in 1996 as a designer and developer of professional pyrotechnic displays, was created to meet local demand.
He began selling consumer fireworks in 1995 to help fund a large display he was creating for his church. The show drew more than 300 people. Word soon spread that Aaron produced a dazzling display. Other local groups asked him to produce shows for them. That led him to research the industry and his local market.
""I proceeded to acquire all the information I needed to meet legal requirements and then I began with three small displays ... for a local baseball team, a local church and a small private show.
After producing and performing those displays he realized this was the business for him. So he created a marketing plan, approached several large display coordinators and started A.M. Pyrotechnics.
""I achieved about $120,000 in sales that first year,"" he recalls. ""From that point on it's been nothing but increases. I still have my first dollar framed. The rest is now history.""
That history over the past 14 years has been anchored by Aaron's philosophy of providing nothing but high-quality displays with top-quality material for the viewing public. While many pyrotechnic practitioners in the U.S. emphasize audible salutes and ""loud boomers"" in their displays, Aaron has always been most concerned with the artistic choreography of pyrotechnics.
""For the displays I design to music, I take the sound track and I match the musical notes to within one-tenth of a second with the fireworks explosions,"" says Aaron. ""When a client completely turns control over to me on a musical fireworks display, I can evoke emotions in the crowd to the point of tears one minute, and laughter another.""
He believes some of the best expressions of his work have appeared at international firework conventions and competitions. Among his peers, Aaron is considered one of the top pyro-musical choreographers in the world. He's been repeatedly asked to produce the display finales for several international conventions in the U.S.
It is this uncompromising emphasis on high-quality displays that recently led Aaron to make a significant change is his business. Last year he decided to move into manufacturing commercial-level pyrotechnics. To achieve the quality product he needed, Aaron enticed long-time friend and industry legend Bill Page from California.
Aaron and Bill met 10 years ago at an international competition: ""I saw two particular shells that appeared to be a considerable notch above all the others I had seen at the convention. I set out to find the man who produced those shells and it was Bill Page.""
The pair maintained contact through the years and Page now works for Aaron, producing ""some of the highest quality fireworks in the world.""
With quality production standards assured, Aaron proceeded to assemble a facility and gather a well-trained manufacturing staff.
""I wanted to bring manufacturing back to the good old USA. We can do it better, much better, and I could provide jobs to a lot of locals,"" boasts Aaron. ""Our technology is a cut above the Chinese, and I always strive to have the highest quality fireworks, not the cheapest.""
However, as he stretched the business, Aaron encountered challenges. A local bank pointed him to the Small Business and Technology Development Center experts at Missouri State University in nearby Springfield for advice. There he worked with Isabel Eisenhauer, SBTDC business specialist. She helped Aaron address some of the challenges of growth, such as managing more people.
""It is difficult to manage a lot of personalities, and keep everyone super safe. The SBTDC has helped me through a lot of the structuring,"" says Aaron.
""But I would say the #1 helping factor was detailed training in creating a business plan for the growth. Few people know how large a task creating a business plan is. Isabel also helped with accounting issues and banking needs. It's tough in today's banking market, and Isabel is helping through many issues with this.""
So by using his natural inclinations, the talents of professionals like Bill Page and Isabel Eisenhauer, and the eager and disciplined workforce in his native southwest Missouri, Aaron Mayfield is tackling the explosive growth of A.M. Pyrotechnics.
""I have entered into a new world of success with Isabel's help.""

Gatekeeper is a world leader in automatic under vehicle inspection and remote access control technologies and is actively involved in combating global terrorism. Its products are designed to provide the first line of defense against foreign and domestic threats. Gatekeeper sells internationally through resellers to other industries such as air and sea ports, oil refineries, and hydro and nuclear power plants.
The company started in 2004 and sales were flat until 2010 when demand increased. Gatekeeper, with four employees at the time, needed a positive cash flow to pay its many contractors as products typically took sixty to ninety days to build. This problem was resolved with Ex-Im Banks letter of credit insurance for lenders. The policy provided coverage to lender BB&T, giving it the required security to loan funds to Gatekeeper.
With a better cash flow, Gatekeeper was able to handle more orders. The company entered new countries beyond its initial customers in Russia, Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, adding Indonesia, UAE, Bahrain, India, Qatar, Pakistan, Ukraine and more to its portfolio. Gatekeeper doubled sales in 2011 and intends to do likewise in 2012. These sales have led to the creation of 2 jobs since 2009 and have supported up to 30 contractors and their respective staffs.
Orders from resellers used to be up to three per order and now they have risen up to 20 per order. Gatekeepers future looks bright as terrorism and insecurity continue to grow worldwide.

Sensis is a leading provider of air traffic management (ATM) solutions and surveillance technologies serving the global civil aviation and defense industries. Its products offer air traffic surveillance and information as well as protection, safety and security to defense organizations with their radar subsystems.
The company, located in Syracuse with 700 employees, was in dire need of working capital as lenders were not willing to take much risk during the recession. Ex-Im Banks working capital guarantee gives lenders the protection and confidence they need in case their customer defaults on its loan. Thus, RBS Citizens Bank granted a $7.5 million working capital loan in 2007 as its risk was limited to just 10% of the loan. The vital cash flow enabled Sensis to increase its exports. In fact, three years later, RBS increased its revolving loan to $25 million to support about $36 million in exports. Hundreds of jobs were saved due to this loan.
Sensis is now known as Saab Sensis since being purchased in August, 2011. It is once again poised for growth and now represents Saab ABs largest presence in North America. It also strengthens the product portfolio within radar, sensors, ATM, and defense systems development. This certainly would not have been possible if not for the role Ex-Im played since 2007.

Hoffman Equipment is a third-generation construction equipment company with deep ties to the New York metropolitan area. In 1920 Bill and Harry Hoffman purchased their first truck and founded Hoffman Motor Transportation to deliver roofing material for installers. During the '60s and '70s, the company began expanding internationally by delivering packages for construction projects overseas, so that all the vehicles and machines required for a project could be purchased and shipped from one single source.
Hoffman Equipment now exports to 80 countries, especially in sub-Sahara Africa, the Middle East, Latin America and Russia. Total export sales represent 20% of this $80 million major dealer and distributor of large U.S. manufactured equipment.
The company has been a customer of Ex-Im Bank for over ten years and attributes most of its export growth to this financing. In fact, in the spring of 2010 Hoffman's export credit insurance agency suddenly cancelled its policy, jeopardizing international sales. To address this problem, the company obtained Ex-Im Bank financing to cover pending transactions and, as a result, protected 15 jobs. Using its Ex-Im Bank policy, Hoffman also anticipates signing a $50 million deal with a buyer in Cameroon for 151 pieces of equipment; the project will support 65 existing jobs and create 41 new jobs.

Ex-Im Bank Product: Export Credit Insurance
Jobs Supported: 73
IKONICS Corporation is an established small business that has thrived since 1952. They specialize in creating and transferring physical and visual images in a variety of industries. From traditional and high-tech screen printing and coated film to decorative and industrial etching and imaging, IKONICS conducts business in over 90 countries.
It was recognized by Fortune Magazine in 2005 as one of the fastest growing small companies in America with 72 employees and is now one of the leading companies in the development of imaging technologies. IKONICS wants to grow more but like most companies, they are concerned about the political and commercial risks associated with large transactions. Thus, they recently obtained a Single-Buyer Export Credit Insurance to insure a $225,000 line of credit on 90 day open account terms for a company in India to purchase film and chemical emulsions. This is IKONICS first experience with Ex-Im Bank and it may eventually use the Banks multi-buyer to enter more markets and cover more buyers.
With the policy from Ex-Im Bank, we can continue to grow internationally without the risk factor - Jon Gerlach, Vice President of Finance and CFO

Jobs Supported: 73
Xamax Industries is a manufacturer of raw materials including rolled goods such as paper, plastic, and nonwoven fabrics. The materials are sold to manufacturers abroad where the final product is assembled. It was 200th small business to be approved for an Ex-Im Bank Express Insurance policy. This purchase resulted from a Global Access for Small Business forum in New Haven, Connecticut, at which Martin Weinberg, the companys president, learned about Ex-Im Banks insurance product line. 
Mr. Weinberg was convinced that with this new Bank product, his company could extend open account terms to international buyers without elevating its risk of nonpayment. Accordingly, Xamax has been able to expand its foreign sales and workforce with this reliable tool. Express insurance streamlines the process of acquiring short-term insurance and enables small businesses to transfer foreign buyer credit decision making to Ex-Im Bank at an economical cost. The online application provides a policy quote and two foreign buyer credit decisions up to $300,000 within five workdays. Besides nonpayment protection, export insurance allows Xamax to provide credit terms up to 180 days for their buyers to pay and hence improve their cash flow.
 We can extend better terms to our customers. For example, we now have a positive balance in China  in other words, we sell more in China than we purchase, which is basically unheard of.

Yerba Buena Engineering & Construction, Inc. is a growing SBA 8(a) certified, small disadvantaged business and HUBZone contractor headquartered in San Francisco. The company provides general engineering construction services to the City and county of San Francisco, and various state and federal agencies in the Bay area. 
Miguel Galarza founded Yerba Buena in 2002. He had worked for various small construction businesses throughout his career and during that time, he had seen too many DBE firms pass up opportunities for long-term growth because they were content to serve as subcontractors. Mr. Galarza was determined to make Yerba Buena a minority-owned prime contracting company.
In 2007, Yerba Buena contacted the MBDA Business Center in San Jose seeking procurement, technical and marketing assistance. The San Jose MBDA Business Center helped the company identify opportunities and establish relationships with public and private sector procurement officers.  Mr. Galarza used the matchmaking forums organized by MBDA to develop new business leads and he used the training sessions MBDA organized and co-sponsored to help build the capacity of key personnel within the company.
With assistance from the San Jose MBDA Business Center, Yerba Buena was awarded a $6.5 million contract with the San Francisco Public Utility Commission in 2011. The contract represented a 30% increase in revenue and created or saved 22 jobs.
The San Jose MBDA Business Center continues to monitor the market for procurement opportunities where Yerba Buena has a competitive advantage as an 8(a) certified and HUBZone company.

"NIST-MEP: Focusing on What Customers Value Stimulates Growth--Montana Instruments Corp","Montana Instruments is a Bozeman, Montana firm that manufactures state-of-the-art optical and cryogenic research equipment.  The Cryostation product breaks performance barriers that allows new research and also makes low temperature research simpler and less time-consuming. The system operates at temperatures approaching absolute zero where all nano-scale motion stops.  The Cryostations minimal vibration enables researchers to more accurately measure results and draw more precise conclusions.  Such research has the potential to lead to nano-size semiconductors of totally new materials created in a lab, with entirely new applications.  Its capabilities and features make it attractive to a wider audience, expanding the market of cold-research. 
In less than two years from the companys start, it evolved from an R&D (research and development) project to a company commercializing with seven employees.  It now has 10 employees and projections of several million in sales over the next few years.
In the early stages, Montana Instruments' founder spent months interviewing researchers around the world about how they use their equipment to determine what they wanted and what they needed. He wanted to gain knowledge about how they use cryogenic systems and what could make one better. In a few years, the company had progressed to actively marketing its product and preparing for a steady production rate to not only keep up with demand but also to increase sales.  For a technology product, a focus on the customer is critical not only during the design phase but also during the marketing phase.  New perspective was needed to see the products value through customers eyes, by identifying why different features are valuable to them. To reach its niche market effectively the company needed a strategic marketing plan, a clear customer message and support pieces to attract buyers.
The firm sought expertise from the B2B Marketing Program, a collaboration of Montana Manufacturing
Extension Center(MMEC), an MSU College of Engineering outreach center and NIST MEP affiliate, and the Montana Department of Commerce (DOC). The B2B marketing specialist worked with the companys Business Development Officer, who had previously been a technology company owner, to bring customer perspectives to marketing and instruction on sales strategy. After defining the product value for customers, the pair collaborated in writing a selling script for cold calling; segmenting potential customers by specialty; identifying a target market; and characterizing the best customer. The Montana Instruments tag line Cold Science Made Simple, is an outcome of B2B marketing meetings. MMEC/DOC B2B taught strategies for trade show setup, promotional ideas, how to engage new customers, and to keep the message simple and clear. The creative ideas for trade show exhibitions have helped attract traffic to the Montana Instruments exhibit booth, visually demonstrating the differences between the Cryostation and competitor products in attention-getting ways. 
The growth project was delivered in tandem with an MMEC engineering project that provided Lean Manufacturing guidance, procedures to achieve repeatability,  and plug and play metrics to reduce rework. This project enabled the company to meet growth head on by planning and managing production efficiently and delivering  products on time even as sales increase. With a marketing strategy and messaging in place and improved production

"Cleveland Company Increases International Customers with Ex-Im Bank's Insurance ","Exporter: Superior Products, LLC  Cleveland, Ohio
Destination: Mexico, Canada, and Middle East
Jobs Created: 3
Exports Supported: +145% over 2010 
Superior Products, LLC, manufactures compressed gas fittings, and related products. Their gas fittings are used in beer dispensers and oxygen gas tanks for hospitals. The company wanted to start exporting and struggled in the beginning of this process to access necessary financing. Then, Superior acquired a $200,000 Ex-Im Bank short-term, multi-buyer policy to extend credit to international buyers. This allowed them to build relationships with buyers in Canada, Singapore, Brazil and Mexico. In particular, the ability to extend credit helped Superior enter the Brazilian market. 
The company was referred to Ex-Im Bank's products from the U.S. Department of Commerce when MAT sought to expand its foreign sales. With the Bank's multi-buyer insurance policy, obtained in August, 2011, the company entered new markets with confidence as they were able to extend favorable credit terms to its buyers and also not be overly concerned about buyer nonpayment. Furthermore, MAT is now able to access more attractive financing with the exporter's lender by using its insured foreign receivables as additional collateral. 
Export sales for the company have grown to 6 percent of total sales and increased more than 145% over exports in 2010. Also, Superior Products has recently added three jobs due to these new sales and is now pursuing customers in China. 
""The Ex-Im insurance is a good sales tool in opening doors to foreign markets,"" said Greg Gens, the Executive Vice President. ""We feel more comfortable by extending credit.""

The company now has facilities in Cleveland and Avon, Ohio. Their parts can be found on car engines across the world.
To expand, the company needed the cash to protect its cash flow availability while growing sales to their Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), especially those in Germany, Mexico, Canada and China. With Ex-Im Bank's Lender Loan Guarantee, PNC Bank was able to provide A.J. Rose Manufacturing with the three-year revolving, $1.5 million working capital loan. Export sales for 2011 are expected to be $15 million (+16% over last year) in exports. These international sales support Ohio jobs and resolved a potential cash flow problem. 
""The Ex-Im line we established has proved to be a cost effective mechanism to provide cash flow availability under our current financing arrangement. This facility has allowed us to grow our export business without an impact to our operating line availability,"" said Douglas E. Krzywicki, Chief Financial Officer.

O-AT-KA, a company name taken from the Seneca Indians, makes a wide variety of dairy and non-dairy based products. In 1959, O-AT-KA received its first tanker of raw milk as it began operations with five employees. The company has now grown to 300 employees and produces and markets a wide variety of value-added dairy products that are distributed globally by Fortune 500 companies. 
In 2010, the financial group of O-AT-KA needed extended credit terms and nonpayment protection for a large customer in Mexico FEMSA Cerveza. FEMSA owns and operates about 7,492 convenient stores and in 2009 was the largest distributor of Coca-Cola products in Mexico. Meanwhile, the company wanted to increase sales by extending terms to international buyers. Ex-Im Bank's single-buyer credit insurance resolved these issues. No fee counsel and full application processing was provided by Trade Credit Insurance Agency, LLC. 
The buyer received 61 to 90 day terms while O-AT-KA obtained nonpayment protection and was able avoid expensive and time-consuming letters of credit.

Dama Jewelry Technology, of Johnston, Rhode Island, a company of 30 employees, manufactures components for the fashion jewelry industry. When Dama obtained an Ex-Im Bank small business multi-buyer insurance policy in 1995, they had limited international sales. By 2011, they had established a diversified customer base, exporting to 153 buyers in 18 countries.
This international growth is reflected in Dama's insurance policy limits which have grown from $250,000 in 1995 to $600,000 in 2011. These figures are quite impressive as most of Dama's shipments are under $14,000. Exports are expected to slow down and only grow 10% over the next few years.
Exports now comprise 70% of Dama's sales with Hong Kong, South Korea and Thailand being its primary markets. Their international buyers sought open account terms just like Dama's United States' buyers. By extending credit, Dama demonstrated their trust in its customers.

This program included a training session in South Africa and a reverse trade mission that introduced delegates to energy efficient technologies, equipment, and best practices. Based on this experience and a relationship forged during the reverse trade mission to the United States, the General Manager of Store Development for Pick n Pay, a grocery chain in South Africa with over 700 stores, placed a breakthrough order for energy efficient skylights from Sunoptics (Sacramento, CA) to enhance natural lighting for its new flagship store that opened in October 2010.

"Supporting U.S. Manufacturing Jobs","In 2002, Rudi Roeslein, Chief Executive Officer of Roeslein & Associates, approached USTDA to fund a feasibility study on the construction of a two-piece can manufacturing facility in Nigeria. At the time Roeslein & Associates was looking to expand into emerging economies, but the company was too small to fund a study on market potential in a country like Nigeria. As a result, USTDA provided $251,080 for Roeslein to conduct a feasibility study to determine if the financial, economic and design of the facility would support the building of the only can making facility in Sub-Saharan Africa. In manufacturing the canning facility, Roeslein builds the modular pieces in Red Bud, Illinois, about 25 miles southeast of St. Louis. Once assembled the individual can manufacturing modules are then shipped in standard shipping containers, and connected on-site to form a full two-piece can manufacturing facility. This type of factory design allows for technical work to be exported, and is easier to assemble than more traditional factory designs where the entire facility is constructed on-site.
Ultimately, Roeslein & Associates partnered with GZ Industries, an Israeli company, along with Ex-Im Bank, to finance and construct the $61 million facility, which is now the process of being erected in Nigeria. Of the total construction costs, $30 million was awarded to Roeslein & Associates to construct the two-piece can manufacturing equipment. 
Based on this success, Roeslein and Associates refunded USTDA the full amount of the grant and said that this project was a priority for our company and presented a real opportunity for our employees to apply their expertise and experience in establishing a world-class can manufacturing facility in Nigeria, and that USTDA's support served as a catalyst in moving the project forward and in providing the bankable documents necessary for the project to succeed. This contract was able to keep 200 workers employed in Red Bud, IL while also resulting in an estimated 125 jobs created in Nigeria. The new can manufacturing facility opened in September 2009.

"USTDA Brings Broadband Access to Africa","As a direct result of USTDA's investment in the visit of a ministerial-level delegation to the United States and a regional ICT conference, over $400 million in U.S. equipment and services exports were utilized by African project managers to bring broadband communications to Africa. Without an undersea fiber-optic cable system, countries in the region relied on costly and scarce satellite links, which could not meet increasing demand for broadband communications services.
USTDA's multi-year effort to support the development of an undersea fiber-optic cable linking East Africa with communication hubs around the world proved successful when a group of African ministers visited the United States, as part of a USTDA-funded program, and convinced potential financiers, including Sithe Global that fiber-optic cable connecting East Africa to the rest of the world could be commercially attractive.
In June 2009, SEACOM became operational offering 1.2 terabytes per second of capacity to enable peer-to-peer networks, IPTV, and high-speed internet access. The 13,700km cable links South Africa, Mozambique, Tanzania, Kenya and Djibouti with India and Egypt. ""The system, which was designed and installed using Tyco Telecommunications' state-of-the-art technology, will undoubtedly provide businesses and citizens in South and East Africa alike with the capabilities they need to communicate with the rest of the world and participate in the global marketplace,"" said Debbie Brask, Managing Director of Project Management for Tyco Telecommunications.
As described by SEACOM's Chief Executive Officer Brian Herlihy, USTDA's multi-year effort was critical to SEACOM's launch. ""The impetus for the cable project is directly attributable to Sithe Global's participation at the half-day briefing sponsored by the USTDA visit.""
The impact of broadband worldwide and the timeliness of the USTDA-sponsored meetings and conference provided a confluence of factors that pushed the imperative for African countries to liberalize the market for all consumers, including American companies, resulting in increased opportunities to do business overseas.

The 47.5 megawatt plant was built in the Aydin-Germencik geothermal field by the Gurmat Energy Investment and Trade Company, a private Turkish company.
During the construction of the energy facility, over $23 million in U.S. exports of goods and services from eight states were utilized, creating high paying export-related jobs in the United States. This amount includes the export of goods and services from Power Engineers (Hailey, ID) and $4.86 million in engineering and consulting service exports that were financed by the Export-Import Bank of the United States. 
According to Henry Veizades of Veizades & Associates, which has provided design work and engineering services associated with the geothermal project, ""USTDA's sponsorship was critical and enabled the project to mature quickly."" The Agency's role in moving the project forward was confirmed by Gurmat's General Manager Ali Karaduman, who stated that the USTDA-funded study provided the detailed project assessment that was critical to project definition and financing.

"Treating Solid Waste in Morocco","City officials in Fes, Morocco were concerned in the late 1990s that solid waste, if not managed properly, would contribute to public health problems and poor living conditions. Responding to a request by the Communaut Urbaine de la Wilaya de Fes (CUWF), the region's inter-city government authority, USTDA recognized a long-term opportunity and funded a feasibility study to evaluate possible solutions to Fes' waste management needs. The study was conducted by Edgeboro International; a New Jersey-based environmental design, management and construction company.
Ultimately, the results of this study are contributing to more than $62 million in U.S. exports for multiple projects. Of particular importance was CUWF's decision to seek bids for the solid waste management project in Fes that opened the door for Edgeboro International (Milltown, New Jersey) and Global Environmental Sustainability, Inc. (GESI) (Princeton, New Jersey) to play a leadership role in its implementation. The 10-year management, engineering and services contract awarded for the construction and operation of a controlled landfill in Fes was the first of its kind in Morocco. This contract was extended in 2007 for another 20 years to recover and reuse the biogas from the landfill by generating approximately 3 megawatts of electricity that could be used for public lighting and reducing approximately 100,000 tons per year of greenhouse gas emissions.
Capitalizing on USTDA's previous efforts, Edgeboro and GESI recently were awarded an 18-year contract for the closure of the old landfill and the construction and operation of a new controlled landfill in Casablanca, the largest in Morocco. The Casablanca project will produce approximately 6 megawatts of electricity and reduce approximately 400,000 tons per year of greenhouse gas emissions.
GESI's President, Dr. Ahmed Hamidi, credits USTDA for setting the stage for these activities, which represent the first privatization of waste management in Morocco. Dr. Hamidi concluded, ""USTDA's initial efforts resulted in the closure of old open dumps, the construction of new state of the art controlled landfills, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and the generation of revenues to several Moroccan communities by the sale of electricity and carbon credits generated from the solid waste.""

"Egyptian Ammonia Plant Opens Following USDTA-Funded Study.","An ammonia production plant in Ain Sokhna, Egypt, was constructed using more than $275 million in U.S. exports of goods and services. A USTDA-funded early investment analysis for the project sponsor, Egypt Basic Industries Corporation (EBIC), laid the ground work for EBIC to move forward with this project, which is providing significant economic benefits to the Egyptian economy. 
The project is part of an effort to increase Egypt's fertilizer output to meet growing domestic and international demands. The USTDA-funded study, which was conducted by the M.W. Kellogg Technology Company, now Kellogg Brown & Root Company (KBR), provided the foundation for the development of a modern fertilizer plant that utilizes KBR technology and conforms to new environmental laws. Based upon the completed study, the Export-Import Bank of the United States approved a $229 million long-term guarantee to support KBR's offer to build the plant. To date, 33 U.S. companies in 11 states have realized business as KBR suppliers in the engineering and construction of the plant. 
EBIC Chairman Basil Elbaz and Managing Director Dr. Amr Hassaballah noted that USTDA's assistance was an effective catalyst in moving the project forward. ""USTDA fueled a first stepand provided a roadmap for us to follow,"" they said.
The plant began operation in 2009 and is producing 2,000 metric tons of ammonia per day. Based on the plant's progress so far, EBIC has taken preliminary steps toward replicating the project on a larger scale, which may lead to significant additional U.S. exports in the future.

"Egypt Transaction Helps Manufacturer Get Back on Track","Exporter:  Morrison Textile Machinery Co. - Fort Lawn, SC

Transaction:  Buyer Financing: Loan Guarantee
Export Sales:  $7 million
A year after 2009 layoffs, Morrison Textile Machinery says a $7 million foreign deal - made possible by the Export-Import Bank - could mean the company doubles its exports this year and maintains or increases the size of its workforce.
With this significant sale, the South Carolina-based Morrison will provide textile manufacturing equipment to an Egyptian company that's opening a denim production facility. The Export-Import Bank's financing helped the customer handle the large scale of the project and provide Morrison with much needed revenue.
""Ex-Im Bank's guarantee helped the customer justify the scale of the project,"" said Morrison President John Morrison White, Jr., great-grandson of the company's founder. ""We are exporting two different textile manufacturing systems to the Egyptian plant at one time. Usually a client orders a single system and then a year later maybe orders again. This double-size sale will have a big impact on our business.""

Jobs Supported: 15
Northern Power Systems Inc., a manufacturer of wind turbines based in Barre, Vermont, is using Renewable Express financing from Ex-Im Bank to export 55 100-kilowatt (kWh) wind turbines for community wind projects in Italy.
The wind towers will be owned by the borrowers  ARG Energie S.R.L., Eoland S.R.L. and PurEnergy Land S.R.L.  special-purpose corporations that will sell all of the electricity produced to Gestore dei Servizi Electtrici S.p.A. (GSE). GSE is a public company wholly owned by the Ministry of Finance and Economy that administers Italy's renewable-energy programs.
The three separate authorizations were processed under Ex-Im Bank's Renewable Express, which provides streamlined limited-recourse project financing to small renewable-power producers that meet the Bank's credit standards. This is the first time that Ex-Im Bank has assisted in financing a community wind-power project on a project-finance basis. These exports, known as distributed wind turbines, will be installed in independent wind towers that will generate power for local commercial use and supply to the power grid. The sale is the largest U.S. export of these kinds of wind turbines to any country.
Ex-Im Bank is guaranteeing a total of $22.2 million in euro-denominated loans from RB International (USA) LLC of New York to facilitate the purchase of 55 Northern Power 100-kWh permanent-magnet direct-drive wind turbines by PurEnergy, a wind-energy developer based in Bisaccia, Italy.
These lender loan guarantees have 15-year repayment terms that enabled Northern Power Systems to compete successfully against European and Asian suppliers backed by financing from their governments' export-credit agencies.
More than 15 jobs are being directly supported by these transactions at the 140-employee company. Northern Power anticipates the sale will also generate 30 to 45 additional jobs in its supply chain.
""The combination of Northern Power's world-class turbine performance with Ex-Im Bank-backed financing offers international customers the potential for very attractive project returns. We look forward to continuing our partnership with Ex-Im Bank to grow our business and expand green jobs at our company and throughout our supply chain,"" noted CEO John P. Danner.

"MBDA Assists Public-Private Broadband Partnership in Central Alabama","Minority firms partner to win a highly competitive $59 million Department of Commerce grant to provide broadband communication service to a substantial portion of the rural, eight-county region in central Alabama.
A team of African-American owned telecommunication businesses in Atlanta pulled together to win a contract that will not only create jobs, but expand access to services to  communities through broadband connections.
The team made up of primary partners Trillion Communications Corporation, A2D, Inc. and A-Plus Community Solutions competed for the opportunity to increase broadband in unserved and underserved communities.
The partnerships focus was to provide broadband service to a portion of a rural, eight-county region in central Alabama, an area which includes Selma, through construction of a 2,200 mile network to augment existing facilities. The project would enhance the communities ability to bring high-speed telemedicine, distance learning, access to web-based legal assistance, and better 911 services to residents in this region, among other benefits.
It is really exciting to have a group of minority businesses in Georgia and Alabama win such a large grant, said MBDAs Southeastern Regional Director Patricia Hanes.  This is such an important project bringing economic development and jobs in these challenging times. We are ecstatic that these companies were victorious in their pursuit of funding for this project.
Patricia Hanes and MBDA were a great help, said Ralph E. Brown, CEO of Trillion Communications Corporation, an Alabama-based certified minority-owned business. MBDA is about creating access, and this was an opportunity to do something positive for the community. We are proud to be a part.
Trillion Communications will serve as the grant awardee, fiduciary and program manager for the grant released by the U.S. Department of Commerces National Telecommunications and Information Administration(NTIA) and the Department of Agriculture Rural Utilities Service (RUS). An additional $25 million will come from private investors.
In addition to creating broadband access, Hanes projects the award opportunity will extend to 25 additional MBEs and service the impacted communities for the next 20 years.
This will make a difference in the community, said Brown. It impacts eight counties, 1,000 businesses and community anchors including public libraries and institutions, HBCUs, 80,000 households, as well as an Indian nation in the Montgomery, Alabama area.  
This partnership includes the three primary partners and the South Central Alabama Broadband Commission  a recently formed consortium of local governments, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, a two-year technical college, medical facilities, municipalities, faith-based organizations, and non-profits and a federally-recognized Indian tribe which together will bring high-capacity broadband to Butler, Conecuh, Crenshaw, Dallas, Escambia, Lowndes, Macon and Wilcox counties in Alabama.  The addition of these services will increase capacity and services available for businesses and residents in the area.
The Trillion team will design, construct and install a next generation broadband infrastructure which will then be transferred to the South Central Alabama Broadband Commission (SCABC), where it will eventually be expanded across the region. A2D Inc. will serve as SCABCs long-term operator of the eCommunity Broadband Network.
Its a historic moment, said A2D, Inc. CEO Antwon Alsobrook. We are very excited about our ability through this medium to transform peoples lives in the Southern Black Belt region. We are treating broadband as a requirement not a luxury. We are happy to be a part of making that happen.
The e-Community Broadband Network will link anchor institutions such as schools, libraries, health care facilities together as well as provide the means for small businesses to expand their markets and help stimulate new business development. It will also enhance public safety services by creating an interoperable network among public safety agencies. For those who cant afford fee-based broadband services from commercial providers, eCommunity will also enable community organizations, anchor institutions, and governmental agencies to offer free or subsidized intranet-based broadband access directly to vulnerable populations they already serve.
Funding for the project is made possible by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act signed in 2009 by President Obama, which included approximately $7.2 billion to expand broadband access and adoption in communities across the U.S. It also means an increase in jobs, more investments in technology and infrastructure, and long-term economic benefits.

"Funk Linko  85 Years in Manufacturing Mastering Core Business and Seeking Out New Markets ","Viola Victoria Linko worked her way up from cleaning offices to CEO in the male-dominated world of steel manufacturing. Better known as Vicky, she and her husband and three children are keeping the legacy alive at the 85-year-old company located in Chicago Heights, Illinois.
After marrying into a family of steel manufacturers, it was only a matter of time before Vicky climbed the corporate ladder to become a dominant figure in the industry. While the oil and rail industries werent always readily welcoming to her, she says persistence is her secret weapon. Offering a good product and perseverance are the keys, said Vicky, who is president and CEO. Its difficult being the woman out front in two of the hardest markets, oil and rail.
Formerly Funk Forging Company, the operation underwent a name change to Funk Linko, Inc. in 2004 to highlight the family name that has been operating the company since 1925. Vicky has been leading the company for more than 28 years, after marrying into the family in 1967.  Funk Linko is a certified, minority- and woman-owned business.
All three of her children have worked for the company, and her husband, William James Linko, Sr., continues to manage accounts in the oil industry. The founders daughter, 93-year-old Hazel, still comes to work every day.  It keeps her going, Vicky said. I think its a great thing. Theres no way she would stop coming in.
Four generations of the privately-owned business have been successful in creating proprietary and patented pole products. Their work can be seen in cities throughout the country including the McDonalds high-rise poles holding up the golden arches stretching 100 feet above the street. Funk Linko is a leading producer of sign, light poles and steel fabrication for major oil companies, fast food operations, hotels, car dealers, airports and municipalities in the United States and many countries around the world. It also offers custom steel fabrication, structural steel fabrication, and engineering services.
The Early Days
Funk Linko played a part in the war effort and received five Army-Navy E awards for excellence in production of items such as crow bars.  It later began manufacturing metal framing to support small signs for Cities Service Company., now CITGO Petroleum Corp.
Initially, the company began making framing for smaller signs like those that youd find swinging at an old gas station. Vicky suggested tapping into work with the oil and hospitality companies, a move that launched Funk Linko into thousands of jobs making sign poles for big names like Marathon Oil Corp., BP PLC and Royal Dutch Shell PLC. From there, the company got involved in the fast foods, hospitals, and airport lighting poles, where things took off.
Vickys pride and joy is the work that was done in 1985 at the OHare airport  what she likes to refer to as the forest of poles. There was a rehabilitation of the entire airport, and we put up every single light pole on or off the runway, including parking lots and international terminals. It was over a thousand poles, Vicky said. This is still one of my favorites. 
Three years ago, the company was asked by Illinois-based National Railway Equipment Co., whose customers include CSX Corp., Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp., Union Pacific Corp. and the U.S. Army, whether the small company could build steel locomotive and freight train frames. After some hesitation, Vicky decided to take the chance. Since then the company has built more than 200 locomotive frames, some of which have been shipped overseas to the Caribbean Islands, South America and Saudi Arabia.
On the Road to Recovery 
Unlike previous industry challenges and dips in the economy, Vicky said they could always rely on hospitals and school systems to continue building projects. When things were down and tough, you always had hospitals and schools. Now schools dont have the big funding authority they used to have.
Weve survived what the oil industry went through in 1983; the impact of the 9-11 terrorists attacks, Desert Storm, but this is the hardest. It has taken a lot to move forward.
Funk Linko is working to fight its way back to its former pinnacle of success when it reached $10 million in sales four years ago. In 2009, the companys sales were just over $5 million
The company currently has 16 employees, three buildings and 70,000 square feet. Vicky plans to build beyond the 32-34 employees the company had when it was in full swing.
Funk Linko has continued to diversify and reach new markets through exporting. We see great opportunities coming up in 2011.
Funk Linko is now in talks with one of the rail companies to start a new project in the U.S. that is currently made in China. She added that the opportunity could create 300 new jobs.  We are trying to see if we can get funding, she said. It would be extremely big. We are considering adding 17 and a half acres. China has had a lock on the market. I believe in globalization, but it has got to be a two-way street.
MBDA has supported Vickys efforts. Funk Linko has been a client of the Chicago Minority Business Opportunity Center (MBOC) and the Chicago Minority Business Enterprise Center (MBEC). Vicky was a part of MBDAs U.S. Delegation of 12 minority-owned firms from various industries including technology, construction, manufacturing and professional services participating in the 2009 China Business Exchange.
During the trip Vicky stated, In the domestic market you focus solely on your specialty and grow the business one customer at a time. To be a global enterprise you must think broader. This program has helped my company change the way we view our business, our capabilities, and our capacity to access the global marketplace and succeed.
MBDA has been a major help, she said. It offers a lot of good advice. Sometimes you need somebody to offer expertise to stay focused.
The company is seeking out new territories globally as well as in the green industry with alternative energy such as vertical wind turbines. Her son, Jim, also has a special passion for connecting the alternative energy concepts back to schools as a teaching tool.
According to her son, plans are in the works to convert the vacant lot across the street from their office building into a facility for wind turbines and a green building.  The company has put up four turbines so far.
Vicky is optimistic about the future of Funk Linko and its expansion plans.
The passion keeps me going, Vicky said.  There is nothing that cant be achieved if you have the vision and passion to make it happen.

"The Del Valle Group Leads the Construction Industry in Puerto Rico","Pablo Del Valle has made it his personal mission to improve the lives of Puerto Ricans through constructing quality projects. Founded in 1988, the Del Valle Group, is a recognized leader in road construction, pavement rehabilitation, bridge construction, marine structures, and buildings and site development.
The Del Valle Group currently has 350 employees and completed more than 197 projects to date. The companys net worth is more than $878.6 million.
Pablos hard work as company president has not gone unnoticed. He has attracted numerous accolades, including selection as the Minority Business Development Agencys (MBDA) 2010 National Minority Enterprise Development (MED) Week Minority Construction Firm of the Year.
MED Week is an annual event that recognizes minority entrepreneurs businesses that contribute significantly to the development and strengthening of the minority business community.
We are very proud of this achievement, not only on a personal level, but also for all employees who work at the Del Valle Group, Pablo said. Several organizations and institutions, such as the Associated General Contractors of America (AGC), AGC Puerto Rico chapter and the Institute of Civil Engineers have recognized this achievement. This award also represents a great honor for the local construction industry and especially for Puerto Rico. 
His other honors include the Contractor of the Year Award from the American Public Works Association; Minority Firm of the Year by the Puerto Rico Highways and Transportation Authority of Puerto Rico; and being named Distinguished Engineer by the Puerto Rico Society of Professional Engineers.
The companys main offices and equipment yard are situated on 16 acres with eight buildings covering more than 40,000 square feet for equipment shops and administrative offices. The companys main office is located in Toa Baja, Puerto Rico.
For more than 30 years, Pablo has excelled in the administration and technical management of major projects for the government and private enterprise, both in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.
His family is deeply involved in the business, including two sons  the eldest is the vice president of the equipment division, and the other son works in the estimating department. His daughter is the general manager of an affiliate company.
Like most companies, the Del Valle Group has not escaped feeling the impact of the U.S. recession. The economic downturn has impacted the Puerto Rican economy. Currently, we are at 2005 billing levels and the backlog is decreasing rapidly. In addition, the financial sector that normally provides financing for new projects has not committed.
We are a company that thrives on planning and problem solving, he said. We consider ourselves a company of solutions. We tackle every project (large or small) with a systemic planning approach. This approach has been a successful tool in our business.
By virtue of the industry, construction is constantly changing, Pablo said. We face challenges every day. Perhaps the most challenging project is currently underway, the Port of Americas Project in Ponce, Puerto Rico. It is the largest project we have undertaken with a value of $84.5 million. 
One of the ways that Pablo has kept his company strong is by adapting to industry changes. We are in constant training through seminars, webinars, dedicated training sessions, and participation in national conventions, such as the AGC national convention. We also keep up-to-date on new industry trends.
Throughout the years, we have established a solid foundation as a company that always completes all construction projects on time. Currently, we have the most diversified equipment fleet in the local industry, coupled with a well-motivated experienced work force, that has allowed us to reach this level of performance.
As far as next steps are concerned, Pablo said the company is broadening its search for opportunities. The local economy is not supporting business expansions, he said. We are looking at other geographical areas for possible work. We recently engaged in the Global Construction Program announced by MBDA. Also, we are looking for possible work in the reconstruction of Haiti as well as other markets.
Pablo points to MBDA as a significant help in developing business strategies to strengthen his company. For federal programs, we are required to prepare subcontracting plans and MBDA has helped us. We also look forward to developing a closer relationship as business opportunities arise.
Pablo currently serves on the board of directors for the General Contractors Association and the Construction Industry Museum Foundation.   
He holds a B.S. degree in Civil Engineering from the College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts of Mayaguez in 1969. 
Pablo said, I am most proud of having a successful business and seeing it grow into one of Puerto Ricos largest construction companies.

"MBDA Helping Minority Businesses Grow: Marion Trucking & Construction ","As the only Federal agency with the sole task of promoting the growth and global competitiveness of the minority business community, MBDA takes great pride in its mission. With 46 centers nationwide, MBDA has a direct impact on businesses throughout the country, with a particular focus on those that are poised to expand.
Over the past 40 years, MBDA has helped thousands of minority-owned businesses grow and has increased contracting and capital access opportunities for MBEs by more than fifteen percent from a year ago. MBDA also has helped to create nearly 6,000 new jobs while saving thousands of existing jobs.
MBDA Director David A. Hinson is challenging MBDA centers and clients to think outside of the norm in order to expand businesses and create new jobs.  Hinson stated, I deeply believe in these principals. Today, we have a window of opportunity to change the world. We can create an entire generation of $100 million and larger minority-owned businesses across industries.
In keeping with that mission, MBDA centers are servicing clients offering access to capital, contracts and opportunities as well as aiding strategic partnerships to help businesses reach their full potential.
One such example is Terry L. Marion of Marion Trucking & Construction, based in Dunseith, North Dakota. The town is primarily a Native American community of about 900 people and located in north central North Dakota approximately 13 miles from both the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation, where Marion is a member and only 13 miles from the Canadian border.
Marion has been a client of the North Dakota/South Dakota Native American Business Enterprise Center since 2003. During this time, Marions company has grown significantly. According to Marion, the company started at about $100,000 per year in trucking and construction and progressed to about $12 million in gross earnings in 2010. He expects to maintain the same numbers in 2011.
The companys services include underground utilities, as well as building roads. Marion has had general contracting jobs as large as $14 million. We are currently working with Kraus-Anderson, a large firm on the Crow Creek Indian Reservation, Marion said. We are performing all of the road building and lagoon and dirt and water and sewer on this project, our part is about $4 million of a $35 million job.
He credits MBDA and their center for much of his companys growth and success.
We have an exceptional relationship with the MBDA of North Dakota. Brek Maxon and Larry Stockert have been instrumental in our success and I thank them for their help and concern, Marion said. They have helped us with financial contracts, business plans and overall suggestions that are helpful in many areas.
The company has on average 35-45 employees, with as many as 68 at one time. With contracts including the Elbowoods Clinic in Newtown N.D., Transit Facility and a 24-complex apartment project both in Belcourt placing the total amount of work with these three jobs at approximately $20 million, according to Marion.
His wife, daughter and son-in-law have joined him in running the company and Marions son plans to come on-board after becoming a civil engineer.
The company was formed in 1989 and originally called Marion Trucking. At the age of 32, he bought out his parents and renamed the company Marion Trucking & Construction. Since that time, he said he has worked to earn a company reputation for quality.
His hard work and business acumen earned him recognition from MBDA. He was the 2006 Regional Minority Construction Contractor of the Year. I like to think we as a team won this award based on hard work and setting a good example for our communities, as well as interjecting money and reinvestment back into our communities through our employees.
However, success doesnt come without challenges. The biggest challenge is getting a financial institution to back you, Marion said. Working with the big construction companies is definitely a challenge, as they are not usually interested in helping your company grow. In my experience, they want to see how much money they can capture through you as a small business. There are some that are an exception to this such as Kraus-Anderson and Comstock Construction.
Bonding is also a big challenge as many sureties want established companies that are bigger and have better financial statements; most smaller companies simply are not as strong financially. Again, there are some that simply will not give you a chance and others that will. Its all about getting someone to believe in you and your company.  
His belief in himself and personal drive comes from the motto that he lives by, Never say Never and Never Give Up.
His future business goals include maintaining growth and quality. I would like to see our growth continue at a slow pace as we become financially able to offer a better quality of life for them and their families. If you can keep up the quality of your work and are still growing and expanding, then its a good thing to grow, but only if the quality remains the same.
Marion also places a premium on strong family connections that sustains him and his company. Family and faith are the key. Without them we are nothing. Looking back at where I started in life and how little we had, I say to myself that I need to work hard, be grateful for everything that God and the good ol United States of America has given me.
Another example of an MBDA client is Group O, Inc., which has used the services of the Wisconsin Minority Business Opportunity Center over the course of a long relationship. The center has worked alongside Group O in many capacities and with numerous current and potential sources. 
Headquartered in Milan, IL, with more than 1,300 employees and revenue surpassing $500 million, Group O is the ninth largest MBE/Hispanic-owned company in North America. It is also a member of the National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC) Corporate Plus program.
Bob Ontiveros founded Group O as a packaging company in 1974. Under his leadership, the company has grown into a diversified business service provider with marketing, packaging and supply chain divisions operating nationwide.

"MBDA Helps Largest Minority-owned Company in Tennessee ","A strong competitive drive is what keeps Andre Gist thinking about how to parlay his success with Manufacturers Industrial Group (MIG), LLC into new ventures. Gist has the largest minority-owned business in the state of Tennessee. Today, he is considering how to diversify his $300 million business while branching out into foreign markets.
His daily routine includes monitoring opportunities emailed through MBDAs Phoenix Opportunity System. I signed up a few years ago, and I have gotten involved again. Since then, I go through the opportunities on a regular basis, Gist said.
With MBDAs help, he is also hoping to participate in one of the upcoming U.S. Department of Commerce trade missions. While he has 1,400 employees and six locations in Tennessee  three in Lexington, two in Athens, and one in Chattanooga  he is exploring the possibility of opening a facility in Mexico.
MIG is a contract manufacturer of welded assemblies and fabricated metals for the automotive and construction industry. The company specializes in automated welding processes, assembly and fabrication.
A key Tier 2 supplier to the automotive industry as well as a major metal fabricator for the commercial and industrial industries, MIG has been in operation since 1998.
The companys customer base includes Johnson Controls ASG, Lear Corporation, Intier Automotive, Fisher Dynamics, ARJ Manufacturing and Nissan North America.
MIG is a full-service metal fabricator for the construction, medical, industrial, military and commercial industries. Gist has also diversified the business, establishing MIG Construction Services, which expects nearly $20 million in sales.
However, the success of the company has been based on his personal drive to be the best and deliver the best. Much of his competitive spirit comes from his successes as a track star in high school and at Bowling Green State University, where he earned a B.S. in manufacturing engineering technology.
After a three-year internship with Westinghouse Electrical Systems, which was a part of his degree program, he launched a career that included experience at General Motors, Ford and Johnson Controls in various engineering and quality engineering roles.
Ive always been competitive. I like to win. There is a lot of opportunity out there. I feel like Im pretty good at putting teams together to go after opportunities.
His leap into entrepreneurship came when a unique opportunity was presented to him to buy into a metal stamping and seat structure company with the understanding that he would buy the owner out and become the majority owner in three years. Gist had done similar work for Johnson Controls, and jumped at the opportunity.  Initially, there were four partners  but there are two remaining.
Most of MIG customers are Tier 1 suppliers to auto makers, Johnson Controls, Lear Corporation and Magna International.
He credits his mentor, Oliver Isaacs the founder of MIG, president and CEO of O&I Transportation and a part of a joint venture with Johnson Controls, as being one of his greatest inspirations. Isaacs provided Gist with the initial business opportunity.
A lot of people dont know who he is. Hes one of the first guys that got into the auto industry in the 1970s on the steel side. Hes done really well. Ive learned a lot from him about the business, Gist said.  I have a passion for the auto industry, but Im realistic. Things are picking up now, but the auto industry is up and down. Its not a high margin type of business as opposed to software, but Ive always enjoyed it.

"MBDA Helps Sister Sky Tap into a Legacy of Entrepreneurism","Monica Simeon and Marina Turning-Robe have accomplished what many have said is impossible  working together as sisters in constant contact and still remaining best friends.
There is great comfort in working with a business partner that you can be brutally honest with and not jeopardize the relationship. In reality that type of relationship is very advantageous to the business, Monica said. We balance each other out with our individual strengths and we collaborate very well and those two elements are extremely critical to our companys success.
Creating Jobs
The siblings are members of the Spokane tribe, located in rural Eastern Washington, where unemployment is hovering around 50 percent. While there is very little private sector development in the area, Sister Sky is one of the few small businesses on the reservation and it is committed to creating jobs and economic diversification beyond casinos.
Staying true to their mission of giving back, the small company uses tribal youth as employees in the summer.
Wealth building in our tribal communities through entrepreneurship is critical if we are going to improve our conditions and solve our own problems, Marina said.
The sisters are descendants of a long line of entrepreneurs. However, it was Monicas search to find a cure for her sons eczema that was the impetus for the business.
After not being able to find a commercial cure, she went back to her roots to identify herbal cures that her family had used to resolve her sons problem. Some of the best businesses started because of a specific need, especially for women entrepreneurs, Monica said. I started tinkering back to the roots of my heritage in terms of herbal remedies. I tried to research what we used before there was a Rite Aide.
Using Social Media
After starting the business off as a hobby, they assessed that there may be room in the marketplace for their products. Using social media, they began to develop a following for their products.
Their product line includes single size products used as hotel amenities nationally and internationally, along with wholesale and retail products.
MBE certified, they are going mainstream with their product and have managed to get into the supply chain of the Wyndham hotel. When you utilize programs like the minority supplier diversity, you have the opportunity to break out of niche markets. We are working on getting into national accounts. We are getting favorable market exposure.
This year, 2011, is a big breakout year for us, Monica said. We are creating alliances, and utilizing our programs. Up until now, weve been in our own little pond.
Like most businesses, there have been challenges  especially in the area of financing. We secured a loan through the Bureau of Indian Affairs Loan Guarantee Program, which helped us build an automated manufacturing facility on our tribal land. We are at another critical growth stage in our company and require additional financing and that is a challenge in these times.
Their journey from mall kiosk, to spa hotels, to their new ventures has included a lot of help including support from the MBDAs Don Chapman, senior adviser on Native American Affairs and the Office of Native American Business Development.
Sister Skys revenue last year was over $500,000 in gross sales.  Primed for growth, theyve come a long way from the $35,000 a year in their early years.    
Their perseverance and drive is rooted in their passion for their products and work. If you love what you do and strive to create meaning to what you sell, or create and do it on a professional level, then I think you have found your purpose, Marina said.
Practices Eco-Stewardship
The company also practices eco-stewardship, which the sisters say makes the product stand out from the rest.
We are working on improving packaging, formulas and manufacturing processes so that we can make a big impact on improving our company to be more sustainable, Monica said. When we share our philosophy on sustainability from our Native American perspective, we hope it inspires both consumers and other businesses to care for the planet.
Sister Sky has received numerous accolades including the 2010 Honoring Native Women award at an event hosted by the U.S. Department of Labor Womens Bureau to recognize their commitment and leadership in Native American communities.
So what keeps these sisters going through the ups and downs of the economy and business challenges? Marina summed it up for the both of them:
In business, you must have the courage and honesty to admit when you fall short. This helps you refine, reformulate, redesign and come back stronger and better. If you cant admit your shortcomings you will become stagnant, irrelevant or just plain arrogant. In a competitive business environment, being any of these will be your demise.

"MBDA Helping Coastal Environmental Navigate Economic Downturns","In the aftermath of Americas darkest hours, Coastal Environmental Group has been called on to assist in some of the worlds toughest and most sensitive remediation and hazardous material removal.
From Ground Zero, Post Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans and the EPA Superfund site in Omaha, Coastal Environmental has had to deliver its best under some of the most challenging conditions.
The father and son owners have developed a remarkable working relationship, with Richard C. Silva Sr. taking the helm as CEO in charge of the overall organization, while his namesake serves as President and manages the day-to-day operations.
I find it both rewarding and satisfying to lead the individuals of our organization as we improve the quality of our lives and the communities that we are a part of, said Richard C. Silva Jr. Spearheading dangerous environmental cleanups, building new and improved public infrastructure, restoring national historic treasures while employing a diverse local workforce are all aspects of my position that truly denote who we are.
For the last 13 years, Coastal Environmental has offered remediation, construction, marine construction, emergency response, demolition, and electrical contractor and wiring. The company has recently expanded its services into the energy efficiency area.
A company that began with a low cash flow, flourished after gaining its first government contract. Coastal Environmental has grown to 120 employees with corporate headquarters in New York, and other locations in the Midwest, Northeast, Southwest, West Coast and New England.
Coastal Environmental received help from MBDA through the New York Business Center. They are an integral part of our introduction and entre to key business contacts and agencies, said Silva Jr.
The Minority Business Development Agency was instrumental in helping Coastal Environmental navigate economic downturns through teaming with other companies as well as corporate repositioning in order to remain competitive in high-demand areas.
Coastal Environmental is a Federal 8(a)/HUB Zone and MBE/DBE contractor with LEED certification, and government contracts including MATOC, IDIQ, and Task Orders.  
The many contracts awarded to Coastal include a $20 million ARRA funded contract from the Environmental Protection Agency for the Omaha Lead Superfund to remove and dispose of lead impacted soils from residential properties. Coastal was also awarded a three-year contract for $5.4 million from the MTA NYCT for the remediation of hazardous materials for New York City. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers awarded Coastal Environmental a $25 million pre-placed remedial action, IDIQ contract for work assigned to districts within the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Northwestern Division (CENWD) and EPA Region II (New York, New Jersey, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Native American tribes or nations located in these jurisdictions.  
Even though some tasks seem extraordinarily challenging, Richard Silva Jr. said the company is ready to rise to occasion.
Although many tasks and goals seem insurmountable individually, the Coastal team has taken charge and continually rises to the challenge, said Richard Silva Jr.
Silva attributes Coastals growth and success to being fair, honest and providing the best services possible.
The secret of our success is being competitive, consistent and not getting discouraged.

"MBDA Helps Foxit Software Innovate Beyond Borders","Eugene Y. Xiong was determined to get a piece of the American dream despite an extremely limited command of the English language and even less understanding of U.S. small business financing. But against the odds and with assistance from the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA), his company  Foxit Corporation  was born.
He recalls five years ago making less than $1 million. Today, the Foxit Corporation has $7 million in revenues due in part to the help of MBDA. Foxit now has offices in the U.S., China, Japan, Taiwan, Korea, and France.
Xiong was referred to MBDA after failed attempts to obtain bank loans and financing.
Our banker recommended MBDA to us, Xiong said. MBDA has been working with us on banking and financial services. 
Foxit Corporation has been serviced at the MBDA San Jose Business Center.
When we were tight on cash flow, MBDA helped us find the right banking service and we got the right cash that we needed to grow our business, he said. They have been constantly in contact with us and provide consulting and referral services. We also received information about the government procurement process.    
Xiong came to the U.S. in 1994 from China, where he was obsessed with computer programming. A friend hired him to work for his software company, but Xiong recalls being so limited in his language skills that he could only order fast food by pointing.
After taking English classes and launching his own business online initially, Foxit was a dream that had become a reality.  Founded in 2001, his goal has never wavered  to produce a product that would be an alternative to Adobe for PDF users.
According to Xiong, Foxit Software Company is the industry leader in the OEM licensing of industrial standard electronic document solutions included in ISO 32000 PDF.  In 2004, Foxit launched Foxit Reader, a small and fast PDF document viewer and Foxits desktop software  Foxit PDF Editor.
We want to bring more competition to the PDF electronic document market once dominated by one vendor, and provide better user experience to our customers and users, Xiong said. In this process, we want to grow our business substantially. 
In addition to taking on Adobe, Xiong is also pursuing the e-reader market space positioning the company among the likes of Amazon and Sony.
Customers licensing Foxit technology for use in their products include Microsoft, Intel, Hewlett Packard and Amdocs. With over 90 million Foxit Reader downloads worldwide, Xiong says Foxit software has become a high quality, affordable and popular alternative to other PDF software tool suppliers. In 2009, Foxit Software Company was incorporated as Foxit Corporation.
What keeps Xiong going is the responsibility to his family, his international team and the quest to make a better product.
The prospect of making some impact on the industry and peoples lives motivates me, as well as the responsibility to my employees and customers, he said. If a business brings new things to society and provides rewarding opportunities to its employees, then I think that it is a successful business.

"Aviation Parts Company Flies to New Heights with the Help of MBDA","For Mariana Oprea failure is not an option. After being laid off due to company restructuring, she founded Interavia Spares & Services (ISS) Inc. in 2003 building on what she knows best  selling aircraft parts.
Her company is a distributor and reseller of aviation parts and materials to an international market of airlines, repair stations and other brokers abroad, with 95 percent of her business in exports. As an international supplier, she communicates in six languages: English, Spanish, Italian, French, Portuguese and Romanian.
I organized it, and built it up based on my previous experience in sales and after models of companies I wanted to emulate, Oprea said. I had to create everything myself and sustain myself along these years.
Oprea started her career in aviation parts working for British Aerospace in 1981 as a contract administrator for Project BAC-111 aircraft built in Romania until 1989. In the U.S., she has worked in the sales of aircraft parts since 1994.
ISS Inc is a marketer and seller of interior panels, components, avionics and consumable/expendable materials for daily requests generated by airlines or repair stations. The company also supplies engine components for Pratt & Whitney and CFM engine types, APUs, wheels and brakes, with all of the items made in the U.S. for Boeing-type aircrafts.
Opreas company sells turbo-prop types such as ATR, Dornier and Saab materials, from her inventory or from brokered parts from U.S. manufacturers or the secondary open market
We offer asset management service, such as monitoring repairs for inventories belonging to foreign airlines, she said. We attend to urgent Aircraft on Ground type situations with exchange parts service, where we export our inventory on hand or brokered inventory to the airline customer, receiving their used parts, monitoring the repairs and returning the parts to stock for further use. We co-sign customers inventories for direct sale to open market  publishing on international virtual market via the internet.
According to Oprea, all materials are documented, traced and certified by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) certificates, or FAA Designated Airworthiness Representatives (DAR) inspectors. She operates the business with the help of one employee, a full-time contractor and two part-time contractors as needed.
ISS, Inc. has had annual revenues of $3 million until 2009, when it dropped to $1.3 million due in large part to the recession. The company started off very well since 2003 and kept growing steadily until 2009. Since the recession started, the revenue has dropped and I am making enormous efforts to find new markets, and secure new customers in South America, Europe and the far East by participating in international fairs and conferences, visiting customers at their location and mailing brochures abroad about my company and the services we offer.
Oprea credits MBDA in providing much-needed assistance as she works to meet her goals of expansion and recovery through building a select customer network with well-established airlines and repair stations and new markets. She also hopes to employ more people and redesign her on-hand inventory.
My goal is to become a designated distributor for a large manufacturer with materials addressing the entire range of aircrafts, Boeing and Airbus, Embraer and others, Oprea said. MBDA proved to be very efficient, well-informed and quick in action to support my solicitation for help.
Sasha Patrick from the Miami MBDA Business Center visited my office twice in a matter of two weeks and introduced me to a financial broker and an Ex-Im Bank insurance broker in order to put up a loan to help the business develop on a larger scale.
Oprea has also faced challenges in her industry as a woman business owner
As a woman it is quite difficult at times to prove yourself and be successful in an industry dominated by males, she said. It requires courage and tenacity to accomplish every project. It requires endless resources of hope and trust in your own ability to succeed.
Other challenges include selecting inventories that address present market inquiries and a client-base that is located throughout the world.
Definitely the biggest challenge is working with a wide variety of people in so many countries, knowing them and keeping in contact with them on a permanent basis, Oprea said. I personally use six languages fluently on a daily basis calling European and South American airlines to solicit their business.
Technical and mechanical details are not always handy, hence it requires a lot of side work and research and information gathering to be able to give a well informed answer back to the airline that relies on your service.
However, at the end of the day it is the love of the work that keeps her going.
Success is trust in yourself and your own capacity, love for what you do, love for work well done, love for people and a desire to see happiness on their faces or hear thank you at the end of a job well done.
Fear God and nothing else. Never give in to challenges, never give up after occasional losses, learn always from mistakes and trust your own strength to overcome hardships.

MBDA has always assisted us. Theyve helped with marketing the proposals that we bidded on, finding funding and bonding since we are half manufacturing and construction. MBDA has helped us all along our timeline of business development, said Sacred Power CEO David Melton.  
Melton describes his work as more than just operating the company, but one that is changing lives while improving the environment. As a Lugana Tribal member, he brings electricity to isolated homes and facilities on the Navajo Reservation in New Mexico and across the nation in rural-remote areas, using wind turbines and photovoltaic modules.
As an emerging clean energy technology company, Sacred Power is experienced in all facets of renewable energy development including: telecommunications, power generation, home electrification, village electrification, and community water.
Sacred Power has extensive experience in designing and installing solar-powered water pumping systems, solar hot water systems, solar hot air systems, and wind turbines.
Its major customer base is federal, state and tribal governments. Major customers include: U.S. Department of Agricultures Rural Utility Service, U.S. Department of Energy, Tribal Energy Program, U.S. Department of Defense, Armys Rapid Deployment Forces, Center for Army Analysis, Army Research Base, U.S. Department of Interiors Bureau of Indian Affairs, Office of Law Enforcement Services, U.S. Fish & Wildlife, State of New Mexicos Energy Office, National Guard Bureau, Parks Division, and multiple tribes throughout the nation.
Sacred Power Corporation is an 8(a) certified, small disadvantaged, HUB Zone Certified and Native American-owned firm headquartered in Albuquerque, NM.
Melton has extensive experience in his field. He learned his craft from the tribal-owned, defense contract manufacturing company  Laguna Industries, Inc, where he worked for 10 years in roles including  budget analyst, program and marketing manager, and contracts manager. In 1997, he created his own company, Diversified Systems Manufacturing, to assist the tribes with their renewable energy development opportunties. In 2001, a partnership was agreed upon between Diversified Systems and Luz Energy Systems to create Sacred Power Corporation.
Sacred Power has received numerous awards. Melton was selected by U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gary Locke to serve on the Secretarys Manufacturing Council, with the task of strengthening manufacturing activity as well as to advise the Secretary. 
At the core of Sacred Power is a respect for nature. According to Melton, the companys philosophy is to use the strengths of the Father to protect the gifts of the Mother.
The strength of the sun and sky is used to protect mother earth, which gives us life, Melton said. We have to respect it.
Next steps for Sacred Power include a move to become a module manufacturer, which includes buying the 6-inch solar cell, encapsulating them under glass. Melton said he plans to make 80,000 of them a year.
In addition, Sacred Power is heading to NASCAR!
Melton, who is a major fan, hopes to bring the idea of solar panels to NASCAR, advertise, network with corporate CEOs, and use the high-profile opportunity to encourage Native American children.
We will be the first Native owner at NASCAR. The driver will be a Cherokee member. We are targeting a November truck race in Phoenix. We want to create more role models for our people. We want to create hope, and let young people know that there are opportunities in solar businesses, and careers in science and technology. We also educate young people by bringing the race car to schools.   
Beyond his love for racing, Melton also describes the NASCAR opportunity as fertile ground for business opportunities in the Southeast, which he says lags behind in renewable energy. NASCAR has a green and diversity program. We want to put solar on their tracks and buildings. Its a way to introduce it to the fans.

American Aluminum International is a small Missouri company that wholesales aluminum sheet, coil, bar and other metals that are used to make large trailers, gas tanks, electrical transformers, etc. It relies solely on exporting  and only to Mexico. Its customers typically take a long time to pay causing a cash flow problem.
Unlike many companies, 2010 was a banner year for American Aluminum International as its sales reached $15 million (+70 percent over 2009). To offset their high accounts receivables due to slow payments and pay vendors, critical funds were provided by its $1.5 million credit line with Bank of America. Ex-Im Bank supported the loan with its working capital loan guarantee. Sales are expected to expand 30% in 2011 so the company is trying to increase their credit line to $2.5 million.

Since 2005, Safety Speed Cut Manufacturing (Safety Speed), a 22-employee maker of power saws in Ham Lake, Minnesota, has had an Ex-Im Bank small business multi-buyer policy. During that time, the companys export sales have increased 20 percent, and Safety Speed expects to add more jobs by the third quarter of this year. This is promising news as the company had to lay off three employees in 2009 due to the economic downturn.

"Bank Approves $39 Million in Export Credit Insurance for Minnesota Small Business","Exporter: BendTec  Duluth, Minnesota
Destination: India
Ex-Im Bank Product: Buyer Financing
Jobs Supported: 50 retained employees (and up to 40 to be rehired)
BendTec, a company started in 1916, provides steel bending and fabrication to a variety of industries. With Ex-Im Bank's nonpayment risk support, this small business of 109 employees obtained a large contract that will maintain and increase jobs in Duluth, Minnesota.
The Bank approved a $39 million single-buyer export credit insurance policy for BendTec that will allow it to sell fabricated high pressure piping, bends and fittings to Technopromexport in Moscow, Russia. BendTec's products will be exported to India for installation at the Barh super thermal power project.
The purchase by Technopromexport represents BendTec's largest ever awarded contract. On its own, BendTec was unable to accept the risk of nonpayment for a contract of this size. However, with the backing of Ex-Im Bank's insurance and a $22 million working capital lender loan guarantee BendTec was able to secure this contract and retain at least 50 employees. This export sale will also allow the company to rehire up to 40 additional employees who had previously been laid off during the economic crisis.
BendTec's export credit insurance policy was brokered by Trade Acceptance Group, a Midwest-based specialized trade finance company, who helped arrange the transaction. The working capital loan was obtained from JPMorgan Chase.
""We are grateful to Ex-Im Bank for providing us with the necessary insurance to mitigate our payment risk,"" said BendTec Vice President and CFO Tom Conrad. ""We wish to thank Ex-Im Bank and JPMorgan Chase for supporting us on this project and for allowing us to enter overseas markets we are less familiar with. These markets are necessary for us to grow our business in these economically challenged times.""

Destination: China, Brazil, India
Ex-Im Bank Product: Working Capital Loan Guarantee
Jobs Supported: 100
MAG IAS, based in Sterling, Michigan, is a leading machine tool and systems supplier serving the durable goods industry worldwide for metal cutting and composites applications. Key industrial markets served include aerospace, automotive and truck, heavy equipment, oil and gas, rail, solar energy, wind turbine production and general machining.
In 2011, the company had a contract backlog and needed more funds to cover standby letters of credit for performance bonds and collateral for advance customer deposits. Otherwise, MAG would have to turn away business as letters of credit are typically required as a condition for conducting business. Ex-Im Bank doubled to $20 million an existing working capital loan guarantee to MAG.
This financing is enabling MAG to handle increased foreign demand for its products, which will expand its sales and help them maintain approximately 100 high quality manufacturing jobs related to their export business. MAG's Ex-Im Bank working capital loan guarantee currently enables them to support $100 million in annual exports to customers in key markets including China, Brazil, and India. With Ex-Im's backing, MAG will now be able to hire additional workers in areas that have been hard hit by the economic recession. Potentially jobs could be added in Fond du Lac, Wisc.; Hebron, Ky.; Port Huron, Wisc.; and Sterling Heights, Mich.
MAG employs more than 1,000 workers in the Americas and operates through several business divisions and subsidiaries.
The guaranteed lender is Burdale Capital Finance of Stamford, Conn., an asset-based lending institution with offices in New York, N.Y.
""The increase in the Ex-Im facility will enable MAG to pursue additional export sales which in turn will secure our current manpower and support new hires,"" said Dave Nowicki, President of MAG Americas.

Tooling & Equipment International Corp. (TEI), a foundry tooling manufacturer, has used Ex-Im Bank's single-buyer export credit insurance to insure more than $15 million of its products exported to Mexico in 2010.
This coverage was critical in helping TEI sell to Nemak, S.A., largest aluminum automotive-component foundry in the world, located in Mexico.
This small business needed the insurance to be able to offer Nemak longer repayment terms and meet the foreign competition. With Ex-Im Bank's support, TEI was able to offer terms of up to 270 days to Nemak so it could compete against European companies. The single-buyer policy came at an especially critical time, since customer General Motors had gone into bankruptcy and the financial industry was in turmoil.
Exports comprised 50 percent of TEI's sales in 2008 and have now grown to 80 percent in 2010. The company employs 145 workers, adding 48 employees since receiving an Ex-Im Bank policy in September 2009. TEI is planning on a 50% increase in sales in 2011.

Auburn Leather Company is a manufacturer of leather laces for footwear and sporting equipment. Since its first year when it had 12 employees and $900,000 in sales, the company has grown to over 110 employees and does over $11 million in sales annually.
Recently, Auburn Leather has experienced an increase in foreign demand for their laces leading to an upswing in sales. This sales increase is in part due to the small business insurance policy the company received from Ex-Im Bank. The assignment of Auburn's insured export accounts receivable gives lenders the confidence to provide working capital advances. These funds have supported the growth of the firm, which has added over 30 jobs in the last two years. In the first nine months of 2011, the company surpassed $11 million in sales (up from $7.4 million in 2009). Export sales now comprise 45% of total sales versus 33% in 2009.

Ex-Im Bank Solution: Working Capital Lender Loan Guarantee
Jobs Created: 2
Qualmark Corporation manufactures accelerated testing systems to find defects in electronics and electro-mechanical equipment. In 2010, its exports have grew 41% after using Ex-Im Bank's working capital loan guarantee in 2008. With this sales increase, Silicon Valley Bank increased the company's loan authorization from $675,000 to $1,750,000.
Due to long pay cycles associated with many international sales, the funding was crucial to the Qualmark. Otherwise, the company would have had to require letters of credit or request advance deposits from its foreign buyers. Both payment requirements would have likely lost sales to competitors that are better able to finance international sales.
""The guarantees provided by Ex-Im Bank have allowed us to more aggressively grow our exports since 2008,"" said Andy Drenick, President and CEO.

It markets more than 40 products and dosage strengths worldwide in the field of gastroenterology, including several that hold a leading market position.  The company's Vandalia, Ohio location employs 170 people.  
The company recognized an opportunity to significantly reduce their energy spends through improved business practices and implementation of energy efficiency retrofits. TechSolve, the Ohio-based NIST MEP affiliate, offered its energy management expertise and its relationship as a facilitator in the State of Ohios Energy Efficiency for Manufacturers (EEM) program to help Eurand find ways to significantly reduce plant energy costs. 
TechSolve facilitated the first phase of the EEM program, an energy management diagnostic, which was followed by the second phase of the EEM program, a detailed on-site energy efficiency audit. The energy efficiency audit quantified the energy usage within the plant and identified lucrative energy saving measures. These reported measures described and quantified the estimated cost, savings, and payback opportunities for Eurand. After a review of the audit, Eurand decided to implement three energy efficiency measures by retrofitting equipment related to its compressed air, waste heat recovery, and lighting usage.  Prior to implementation, Eurand, with TechSolves assistance, applied to the state of Ohio for grant funding (this is the third phase of the EEM program), and 50% of its implementation costs were subsidized. The Energy Efficiency for Manufacturers program was so successful for Eurand that it is planning to implement additional energy efficiency measures in the future.
Results:

"Alliance Rubber Innovates New Products in New Markets","Founded in 1923, Alliance Rubber (Alliance) is the largest domestic producer of Rubber Bands in the United States.  It employs about 150 people in its Hot Springs Arkansas plant.
Since 2003, Alliance has worked with Arkansas Manufacturing Solutions (AMS), a NIST MEP affiliate, in business strategies and continuous improvement projects.  Alliances CEO, Bonnie Swayze, knew that they could not lean themselves to profitability.  They needed to grow revenue as well as control costs.  Starting in 2007, Alliance began having difficulty in developing new products.  There was a two year drought with no new products introduced.  In addition, the increasing price of crude rubber, their main raw material, had been hitting record highs in the last couple of years--eroding into their profit margins on existing products.
Alliance realized that to remain competitive in the current business environment, it was necessary to be ready, willing and able to make changes and be innovative in its product development and process improvement.  Beginning in 2008, Alliance had the opportunities to participate in several innovation engineering-related events sponsored by AMS. Since then, they have used the methodologies and tools, and were successful in introducing ten innovations (five in the past year alone) and all had a positive impact.  They plan to introduce three to four new products every year utilizing the techniques learned at the training. 
Bonnie and her team of 150 associates at Alliance intend to continue to use their innovative skills to continue their 80+ year record of excellence. The high price of crude rubber has slowed three additional innovations but a new pricing matrix developed using the innovation techniques they learned, allows them to adjust prices in one week as opposed to the previous three months. This ability lets them focus on products where there is higher profitability and less impact from the high rubber price.  Going forward they now have a system in place to continuously develop new products on a regular basis.  They can have new ideas fully thought out (market penetration, threats, and costs) in 40 days.

AFrame Digital, Inc. is located in Reston, Virginia and currently has approximately 10 employees.
AFrame Digital was developing a next-generation remote, wireless health monitoring system for the growing eldercare market. The company was awarded multiple research contracts and grants including an SBIR (Small Business Innovation Research) grant from the National Institute on Aging (NlA), part of the National Institute of Health (NIH). The idea was to develop a non-intrusive wearable monitor worn on the wrist that can detect falls and continuously monitor an individual for instability during regular activities of daily living, because falls are the leading cause of accidental death in people over the age of 65 in the U.S. In order to commercialize a medical device, a 510(k) application needed to be submitted to the FDA for product pre-market notification. AFrame Digital intended to manufacture and market this device.  GENEDGE ALLIANCE, a NIST MEP affiliate,  was brought in to assist in the commercialization of the new wrist-based wireless monitor. 
In order to obtain the necessary FDA clearance, GENEDGE created a plan for AFrame to complete and submit the application process.  The proposal included working directly with the client and using the services of a third party GENEDGE service provider, DP Distribution & Consulting LLC, to achieve project objectives.  AFrame staff were trained on the application process, including a train-the-trainer module for training future personnel.  A risk assessment analysis was then performed to ISO 14971 standards.  GENEDGE also helped AFrame communicate design requirements to its specification developer and helped create a software validation strategy and implementation plan.  Product labels were then developed, and the final 510(k) application was submitted to the FDA.  Approval for the new device was obtained, allowing AFrame to move forward with product commercialization.

B/E is the first manufacturer to participate in North Carolina's pilot E3 initiative, a NIST MEP project involving EPA and others.  The E3 (Economy, Energy and Environment) is a collaborative program which includes federal, state and local agencies working together to help manufacturers be more competitive and sustainable. The E3 program provides consultation, access to resources for implementation and solutions, and a self-sustaining component where manufacturers may share best practices and meet their long-term sustainability goals.  B/E Aerospace became involved in this pilot program after recognizing the synergy between the business plan that they were executing and the business model that the E3 initiative was promoting. 
E3 leveraged experts in each field of assessment.  As a team, the experts assessed, compiled and recommended improvements to form one comprehensive, strategic report. This report included baseline data, the improvement metrics designed to address specific problems, as well as savings determined from implementation.  B/E's unique set of assessments included: 
Economy
Steven Forrest, NC MEP improvement specialist and Shingo expert, encouraged ownership of work zones by the actual workers operating in that zone and recommended a report-out to management on each teams ongoing continuous improvement activity, which helps build leadership. 
Energy
An assessment of energy use was conducted and the findings were typical including turning off all equipment at night, repairing air leaks, and installing lighting occupancy sensors.  Using the EPA Climate Leaders Simplified GHG Emissions Calculator, B/Es carbon footprint was calculated.  B/E is now trained to use the calculator and can self-evaluate their GHG emissions using the results as a key sustainability indicator moving forward.

Anvil has been supplying products under various brand names since 1905.  The company supplies grapples and buckets in hydraulic, electro-hydraulic, and traditional cable operation.  They also repair and service older units, supply parts, and re-engineer off-brand buckets for greater performance. Anvil is the only U.S. manufacturer of clamshell buckets that has passed a two year testing program of the U.S. government for quality and strength. 
After Jon Craft, President, and Jay Landaiche of ANVIL attended the Innovation Engineering Leadership Institute (IELI) in Louisiana they began implementing the Innovation Engineering System within the company.  Each month they sent additional staff members to IELI trainings in various states, with roughly 10% of employees having attended a session.  They wanted to help improve the creation of new ideas for products, services, process improvements, markets, and marketing messages.  ANVIL requested that the Manufacturing Extension Partnership of Louisiana (MEPOL), a NIST MEP affiliate, conduct an Innovation Engineering event to accelerate the implementation of the concepts learned in the IELI. 
MEPOL trained 21 employees at ANVIL's facility, focusing on a ""Fail Fast, Fail Cheap"" concept from IELI. Several product ideas were conceived and concept cards were created.  One of the top product ideas was the Quick Connect Tines, which could have reduced customer down time by more than 50%.  Using the Innovation Engineering System methods and coaching by MEPOL, ANVIL quickly developed potential ""death threats"" for the product, the math game plan, and began cycles of learning to ""fail fast and fail cheap"" on this new product idea.  They prepared and conducted a customer survey to get product concept feedback, which revealed that customers thought the new product too costly given the initial cost of the first purchase.  So the team went back and looked at other ways to package the new idea.  They did calculations on a two year package as apposed to the upfront initial purchase to see what the savings might bring.  While working the math game plan on this scenario, they realized once again that the savings to the customer were not enough to proceed and the idea was killed (a good thing in the IELI philosophy).   They celebrated this because it helped the company to reduce risk.  Previously, ANVIL likely would have had the idea, created a prototype without customer input, then tried to sell it which would have resulted in a lot of time, materials and inventory space wasted, and no sales in the end.

The 26-acre plant pumps $23 million into the local economy each year, through wages, supplies and other expenditures. The FMC BioPolymer business manufactures products for the food and pharmaceutical industries in Europe, Asia and Maine, in addition to Newark, which specializes in sophisticated goods for such customers as AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Nestle.
Weve always been the plant that takes on the difficult products our competitors cant copy, and then develops the new products that add value for customers says Graham Moore, FMC Newark plant manager. FMC is intent on growing that segment of the market. Newark had doubled production over the past 15 years but was at risk for being passed over for expansion in favor of a location in Asia, where labor costs are lower. The local plant needed to prove itself by raising the bar even higher. To find ways to squeeze new efficiencies out of the operation, FMC turned to the Delaware Manufacturing Extension Partnership (DEMEP), a NIST MEP affiliate.
DEMEP helped the company arrange for a training grant through the Delaware Economic Development Office. One of the most effective ways to increase productivity is to decrease down time, the minutes and hours drained by bottlenecks in work flow or breakdowns of machinery. The plant already had an admirable overall equipment efficiency (OEE) rate of 82%. 
DEMEP mapped operations at the plant and analyzed processes for maintaining equipment. They discovered that a significant number of repairs were done on an emergency or unplanned basis. By predicting and scheduling repairs, FMC could minimize disruptions and keep the work flowing.  Workers were trained in total productive maintenanceknown as TPMin small groups of about 12, with each group devoting an entire week to the process, which represented a significant investment in resources. We believe learning best practices and becoming a world-class operation are worth the investment, Moore says. It pays off in future productivity and better morale. FMC now can accurately predict when maintenance is imminent. That enables workers to make small adjustments or repairs before serious problems develop.  As a result, the rate of emergency work declined and taking a proactive approach to maintenance also will pay off in safety.
Results:
Created 8 new jobs
25% plant expansion instead of broadening Asia operations
Increased completed job orders by 30%

""DEMEP helped to safeguard the future of this plant for many years to come.  That gives us a great sense of security about the 105 people who already work here.""  Graham Moore, Plant Manager

"New Contract Creates New Jobs and Increases Sales","Established in 1975, Ne-Mos Bakery is based in Escondido, California. The company's product line includes Cake-Breads, Cake Slices, Cake Squares, Cinnamon Rolls, Coffee Cakes, Mini Loaves, Muffins, Danish and Specialty Cakes. The 200 employee organization prides itself on only using fresh ingredients and adhering to the principles of scratch baking. Ne-Mos products can be found in convenience stores, delicatessens, quality fast food chains and catering circles nationwide. 
The company's sales relied heavily on the effectiveness of the production line of its main product, square cakes. Increases in production and labor costs on that line were impacting the organizations profitability and job preservation. The company needed to improve operational efficiencies and identify capital improvements to increase plant capacity while reducing costs.  Ne-Mos had another challenge. A national coffee chain wanted to enlist the companys services to create small decorative cupcakes. This was a major sales opportunity, as the product would be sold in stores nationwide. Ne-Mos needed assistance preparing for the increased production requirements associated with the contract. The coffee chain had mandatory inventory level requirements and the process to create the cupcakes was complex and labor intensive. The company needed help to design the production line in the most efficient way possible.
Ne-Mos turned to California Manufacturing Technology Consulting (CMTC), a NIST MEP affiliate, for assistance based on a positive past experience with the Manufacturing Extension Partnership of Utah (another NIST MEP affiliate).  CMTC consultants conducted a planning meeting and worked with plant management to understand its current manufacturing operations. This information was used to develop Value Stream Maps which served as the basis for designing and implementing continuous improvements. CMTC provided a report with specific recommendations on plant layout and equipment considerations with the goal to increase capacity while reducing production and labor costs. CMTC provided training and simulation exercises for the company. Ne-Mos found the workshop so beneficial that it enlisted CMTC to come back for further support. CMTC provided onsite coaching and facilitated project implementation, worked with management to identify additional continuous improvement projects, and provided change management coaching. CMTC was also instrumental in assisting Ne-Mos with meeting requirements for its national coffee chain contract. CMTC helped the organization determine how the new production line would integrate into its existing plant layout and processes.  They worked with staff to conduct tests to determine how to meet inventory cycle requirements while developing the new line layout to ensure an efficient process. Ne-Mos conducted its first week of testing for the national coffee chain and met all of their requirements. It now has the capability to exceed the current coffee chain forecasted sales requirements.

"Windcreek Services, Inc. Reaps Benefits of Innovation Engineering Leadership Institute","Windcreek Services, Inc., established in 1978, began as a well drilling company developing shallow oil wells, as well as domestic water wells. Over the years it has diversified into oilfield electrical fabrication and underground utility manufacturing and placement. Windcreek Services employs 50 people at its facility in Gillette, Wyoming. 
Windcreek Services was seeing a steady decline in projects due to the reduction of coal bed methane work and the slowing economy. In addition, the management team had been unable to define a plan and vision for the future and to eliminate the current dilemma. The company contacted Manufacturing-Works, a NIST MEP network affiliate, for assistance.
Manufacturing-Works encouraged several employees of the company to attend the Innovation Engineering Leadership Institute (IELI) in Casper, Wyoming. At this institute, the team acquired the tools to create, communicate, and commercialize meaningful, unique ideas. They also learned how to implement an action plan to follow through on their ideas. The action plan was implemented following a new process for determining and overcoming the largest barriers quickly and easily and with confidence derived from their newly acquired skills and thought processes. This plan-do-study-act process allowed the company to make some decisions, test them, and rapidly move in the directions that made the most sense to implement in a short time at a limited cost. Windcreek Services introduced the Asset Recovery System (ARS) to remove existing utility infrastructure and components that are no longer needed and/or no longer in use or serviceable in their particular location. Windcreek Services now helps clients collect additional value on investment, minimize plugging and abandonment costs by recovering, removing and/or selling obsolete, scrape, surplus or waste materials. In addition to providing a safer outdoor environment, itemized inventory lists and revenue from sellable material, the process also minimizes material cost and liabilities while strengthening the clients environmental positioning.

Love & Quiches started in Susan Axelrod's kitchen in 1973. The company  now sells desserts to countries in the Middle East, Far East, and Russia. The business outgrew the kitchen, the garage, a small local storefront, a first factory and is now a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Freeport, New York.
Like many small businesses, Love & Quiches depends on lines of credit and other forms of working capital to finance and grow its business. In the process, lenders review the quality of any company's outstanding accounts receivables to determine how much they are willing to lend. But they are wary of foreign receivables. When Love & Quiches applied for financing with Wells Fargo Bank, Ex-Im Bank's small business export credit insurance backed by the U.S. government, provided the reassurance needed for Wells Fargo to advance funds against the company's foreign receivables improving its cash flow.

"Iron Hill Brewery","Company Name:  Iron Hill Brewery and Restaurant
Location:  Wilmington, Delaware
In the early 1990s, Kevin Finn and his soccer buddy Mark Edelson would spend their Sunday afternoons watching football and fermenting home brew kits. Finn recalls that their first attempt, Dog Blaster was a really dark, nasty beer and eventually was consumed by his dog Shredder. They continued to create different brew combinations, and in 1993 they won their first of many awards.
The two friends had personal advertising and engineering experience, but to start their own business they needed someone who had previously worked in the restaurant industry. They teamed up with Kevin Davis, who had twenty-four years of experience in the restaurant business, and decided to open their own brewery. In 1996, the trio received a $400,000 SBA 7(a) loan, which they combined with their personal savings to found their company.
On November 14, 1996, C&D Brewing, doing business as Iron Hill Brewery and Restaurant, opened in Newark, Delaware. The company grew quickly in size, and earnings. In 1998, Iron Hill utilized the SBA 504 loan program, to obtain $308,000 to open their second location in West Chester, Pennsylvania. By 2000, there were three Iron Hill Restaurant and Brewery sites, employing 300 people and earning $12 million in sales.
The growth has continued, and today Iron Hill operates eight restaurants in three states and employees more than 750 people. Revenues continue to grow again and last year sales topped a record $35 million. Finn indicates that the goal is to continue to open about one new location a year until we reach twenty restaurants. We want to keep a footprint within 100 miles of Wilmington.

"Harley-Davidson, the Motorcycle Manufacturer, Overcomes Bahrain Trade Barrier ","Harley-Davidson, headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, overcame a foreign trade barrier that threatened to prevent access of its motorcycles into Bahrain with the assistance of the Department of Commerces Trade Agreements Compliance Program led by the Market Access and Compliance (MAC) Unit. 
Why it Matters: If the United States did not assert its rights under the U.S. Bahrain FTA in the case of Harley-Davidson, other American businesses might find themselves losing benefits the U.S. negotiated as part of the agreement. 
The Problem: Harley-Davidson was denied duty-free access for its motorcycles manufactured in the United States as provided for under the U.S.-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement (FTA); instead it was charged a 5 % duty. The Government of Bahrain (GOB) claimed that because the motorcycles were not imported directly into Bahrain from the United States and instead were transshipped (shipped through a third country), they therefore did not fulfill the FTAs rules of origin which would grant Harley-Davidson duty-free access. 
The Solution: A team of ITA specialists and representatives from other USG agencies advocated on behalf of Harley-Davidson and provided specific guidance on the FTA rules of origin for transshipped goods which resulted in the GOB allowing for transshipment stop-overs. In addition, MAC and representatives from U.S. Customs and Border Protection provided training to Bahrain customs officers. Due to these efforts, Harley-Davidson was granted duty-free access and has received a refund of all duties paid from the Government of Bahrain. This solution will also benefit other U.S. exporters to Bahrain who transship their products. 
Working closely with U.S. companies, MAC creates, expands and defends market access for U.S. goods and services overseas. We promote policy that develops a more favorable business climate for U.S. companies in global markets; we employ commercial diplomacy to resolve trade barriers; and we leverage our bilateral and multilateral trade agreements to ensure our trading partners live up to their commitments so that our businesses can compete on a level-playing field. - Assistant Secretary for Market Access and Compliance, Michael C.

"Swift Response by International Trade Administration Secures Open Market in Taiwan","The Department of Commerces International Trade Administration (ITA), led by its Market Access and Compliance (MAC) unit, recently helped Air Products, a specialty gas supplier located in Allentown, Pennsylvania, to overcome a foreign trade barrier that threatened to exclude it from Taiwans market.  
Why it Matters:    Air Products reported that Taiwans failure to recognize U.S. container standards for specialty gases would have had the effect of locking Air Products out of its lucrative market in Taiwan with a potential loss of $50 million in annual sales. 
The Problem: Taiwans mandatory technical requirements were based on a unique national standard, unnecessarily limiting U.S. access to Taiwans market.  Air Products specialty gases are supplied to Taiwans manufacturers for use in many of Taiwans high tech industries.  Taiwans authorities temporarily halted a shipment of these gases, claiming that trailers built to U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) standards were not acceptable for the transport of the specialty gases within Taiwan.  Although Taiwan authorities released the shipment as a temporary solution, Taiwans failure to permanently permit the transport of specialty gases in DOT-certified containers would have resulted in a loss of considerable revenue as well as industry competitiveness for Air Products in Taiwan.  
Solution:  A team of ITA specialists advocated to Taiwans authorities on behalf of Air Products to accept the DOT standard, thereby allowing shipments to resume.  The team leveraged Taiwans WTO obligation which requires that Member countries ensure that mandatory standards are no more trade restrictive than necessary.  As a result, Taiwan officially adopted the DOT standard, and Air Products regained access to one of its most important foreign markets without having to restructure its manufacturing process for a single market.
Working closely with U.S. companies, MAC creates, expands and defends market access for U.S. goods and services overseas.

"Minority Business Development Agency's Native American Business Enterprise Centers Help Rural Communities","As a second generation owner of a steel company, some might say that entrepreneurship flows through Russell E. Robertsons blood. His company, American Steel Placers, Inc. is located in San Bernardino, CA and has contracts with city, county and state agencies to supply and place rebar (reinforcement steel) for concrete structures.
Created in 2004, American Steel Placers specializes in bridge construction, community public works and commercial buildings.
As a child, he watched his mothers strength raising four children alone and managing the company she worked for in the male-dominated steel industry. By the time Robertson was 14 years old, his mother had bought out the stock to become majority owner at Puget Sound Steel after the owner died. She operated the company for 12 years in Seattle, where Robertson worked in the evenings after school for four years. He later moved to Los Angeles continuing in the steel business building bridges.
However, the entrepreneurial call became irresistible. Unlike many entrepreneurs who are motivated by the need to control their own destiny, leave a family legacy or simply make money, Robertson was motivated by the intense needs he saw in his community.
Starting out, I made more money working than I did with my company, Robertson said. I was working for the largest steel company in the U.S. as a foreman. I was there for 25 years. Something pushed me to start the business.
When he launched out on his own, he started with four employees and $100,000 in revenues. Today, seven years later, he has 30 employees and the firm generates between $5 to $10 million.
I attribute the growth to really good people, he said. We run on very low overhead and we multi-task everyone.
He also credits the MBDA Native American Business Enterprise Center (NABEC) for guiding and assisting him along the way.
I wouldnt be where I am now if it werent for them, Robertson said. I found them by chance on the internet when I was looking for help. Ive worked with the California MBDA NABEC since I started in 2004 with Curtis Feaster and they are still helping me.
The MBDA NABEC helped me with lending contacts with certain municipalities. They introduced me to the American Indian Chamber of Commerce, and introduced me at meet and greets with certain agencies so I was able to make contacts and bid on work. Once they saw our work, the relationship developed from there.
I wouldnt have had a chance to get my foot in the door without them.
American Steel Placers now has a facility on four and a half acres with four overhead gantry cranes for lifting heavy metal for fabrication, and two automated reinforcing shear lines.
Robertson attributes his persistence and drive to his mother, who is a full-blood American Indian. She would never let circumstances stop her. She had it rough.
He has used his good fortune to help others by supporting orphanages in Burma, Southeast Asia, and Africa through his church. In addition, he supports his churchs mobile medical unit that does basic health checks, and its food bank which feeds 5,000 families a month in San Bernardino County  the largest food distribution in the county according to Robertson. He also supports a training program that helps people transition off welfare services.
I thought if I had money I could help out more. Thats why I started the business.
Just as important as it is to be a success in business, Robertson said he strives to be just as successful in life by living by the motto, Do unto others as you would have them do to you.

"MBDA Helps MSF Global Solutions Grow Beyond Hurricane Katrina","Life in the Big Easy has improved greatly for Marseyas S. Fernandez. His integrated digital solutions company, MSF Global Solutions, survived Hurricane Katrina and is rapidly growing to move beyond a regional focus to a global one.
A native of New Orleans, Fernandez is the founder of the company which specializes in Geospatial Information Services (GIS) and Information Technology development, implementation and management.
Started in 2003, MSF Global was established to provide local governments, universities, businesses, and charities with cost effective GIS and related IT services. Since its inception, the company has used GIS as a key technology in land records management, infrastructure management and economic/community development.
Under Fernandezs initial conception and guidance, the City of New Orleans launched the Enterprise GIS System and Community on ONE Page, a portal designed to provide near and real-time information regarding the citys Hurricane Katrina recovery efforts.
MSF Global is expanding its capacity to provide interactive and integrated digital solutions in a variety of platforms. As a result, the company has worked on numerous projects for the City of New Orleans including the redevelopment of the New Orleans RTA website and mobile application, as well as the City of Miami, Department of Economic Development, tasked with providing expert consultation in developing economic development GIS collaboration for the department.
MSF Global Solutions has implemented several websites for transit systems around the country along with Veolia Transportation and is working on several web solutions for companies throughout the United States.
Prior to starting MSF Global Solutions, Fernandez had a career working for companies that included Bowne Management Systems, a leading provider of GIS services, Mel Engineers and the Urban Technical Assistance Project. He led GIS operations and gained considerable experience in working with all aspects of local government agencies and community-based organizations to deliver GIS and Web solutions.
According to Fernandez, he has witnessed his firm grow from $650,000 to $1.7 million from 2008 to 2010, which was a period where many firms saw their numbers decline. Fernandez said he expects to increase revenue this year due in large part to new partnerships.
We had our challenges because of our heavy dependency on state and local government, Fernandez said. We had 100 percent renewal since 2009. Thats what helped us grow.
He also attributes much of his success to the assistance that he received from the Louisiana Minority Business Enterprise Center (MBEC), located in New Orleans. The center is federally funded by MBDA.
Ive had great relationships at the center, Fernandez said.  Its meant a lot of introductions and networking. Our last three engagements have been a result of the center. Theyve created a great platform to put the word out there, and we put ourselves in the position to respond. Eileen Carter is one individual who has been very persistent and consistent in terms of making sure that we are taking advantage of opportunities.
While Fernandez is passionate about keeping his base in New Orleans, he is just as adamant about expanding his global reach. Fernandez said he is establishing partnerships in India and Germany.
My goal is for MSF Global to be a long-term partner with other governments and entities on a global scale. We want to provide services that make a difference and we are looking for partners that we can be in a complementary relationship with.
MSF Globals work has not gone unnoticed. The company has received awards including ESRI Business Partner of the Year State and Local Government Sector, City of New Orleans Web Development Award, GNO Inc. Special Achievement in GIS Award, Digital Government Best of the Web Award, and Special Achievement in GIS Award.
At the age of 38, Fernandez said he is motivated by innovation. Its the constant pursuit of innovation that helps to solve problems, he said. There are a lot of tools that are developed that are cool and easy, and cutting edge. For me, its about connecting that to everyday life or addressing something that represents a concern, problem or need that hasnt been considered. We are always looking at the next level of opportunity or need.     
Fernandez said his companys motto is, If you can imagine it, we can deliver it.
Im always thinking about pushing the boundaries. I try to create a culture where people are free to think outside the box, he said. The best part of my job is the ability to collaborate with the people around me and with customers. I get a rush being able to talk to people about ideas and solutions. Im always thinking, how do we solve something using technology?

"International Trade Administration Overcomes Costly EU Regulation ","The International Trade Administrations (ITA) Market Access and Compliance (MAC) unit led a government-wide effort to exclude PVC (polyvinylchloride) from the European Unions list of restricted substances used in electrical and electronic equipment (known as the revised RoHS Directive). As a result, The Vinyl Institute located in Alexandria, Virginia, which represents PVC manufacturers, estimates that $137 million of U.S. exports to the EU were preserved. 
Why it Matters: PVC is commonly used as a flame retardant and insulation in electrical wires, power cords, and control devices. PVC is also crucial in making washing machines. U.S. industry was concerned that an EU restriction on PVC would have forced them to replace PVC in their manufacturing process, not only in the EU but worldwide. The costs to do so would have been prohibitive. 
The Problem: In 2010, the European Parliament proposed adding PVC to a list of banned substances as part of its revisions to the EU RoHS Directive. Banning PVC would have led to a prohibition of PVC in products such as washing machines, electrical wires, power cords and control devices. 
The Solution: ITA brought together representatives from U.S. industry, trade associations and government to avert this costly EU proposal. Representatives from the U.S. Mission to the EU worked with their counterparts at the Commission and the European Parliament to ensure U.S. industrys perspective was fully considered. In Washington, senior ITA officials engaged commercial officials at key EU embassies. ITA worked with the State Department to share industry views with key environmental officials in various European Union Member State governments. As a result of this coordinated, cooperative, government-wide effort, the EU decided against adding PVC to the list of substances under review, saving an estimated $137-million in U.S. exports to Europe.
Wayne Morris, Vice President of Division Services of the Association of Home Appliances (AHAM) noted, The Commerce Department was uniquely positioned to assist the business community by bringing together the U.S. Mission to the EU, USTR, and several key offices at Commerce headquarters to rapidly react to this ill-conceived proposed regulation. 
Allen Blakey, Vice President, Industry and Government Affairs at the Vinyl Institute added, The companies whose manufacturing jobs were protected are grateful for the Departments good work.

"U.S. Distilled Spirits Companies Win Resolution of Customs Valuation Concerns in Thailand","The International Trade Administrations Market Access and Compliance (MAC) unit worked with the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS) to change Thailands customs valuation procedures that had led to increased costs for U.S. distilled spirits exports to Thailand.  Through ITAs intervention, the companies also received long-awaited refunds of overpayments made as a result of Thai Customs inappropriate valuation determinations. 
Why it Matters:  Thailands valuation procedures were improperly increasing the customs value for imports of distilled spirits, forcing companies to pay additional duties and taxes.  It was especially important for the United States to ensure that Thailand upheld its obligations under the World Trade Organizations Customs Valuation Agreement so that other American exports to Thailand would benefit from the transparency and predictability provided in the agreement.  
The Problem:  Beginning in August 2006, Thai Customs began using an inappropriate methodology to determine the customs value of imports of alcoholic beverages.  Under this new approach, the customs duties and taxes owed were inappropriately raised.  The United States persuaded Thailand to revise its procedures.  However, two DISCUS member companies encountered difficulty getting refunds for the higher payments they had made based on the earlier, inappropriate, customs valuation determinations.  
The Solution:  A team of ITA specialists and representatives from other USG agencies persuaded Thai Customs to follow the procedures prescribed by the WTO Customs Valuation Agreement, and in March 2008, Thailand resumed its acceptance of the declared invoice value for imports of alcoholic beverages.  By October 2010, with continued assistance from ITA, the last two members of DISCUS received full refunds of the cash deposits and bank guarantees that they were force to pay based on the higher, inappropriate, customs valuation determinations.

"Agro Farma - Chobani Yogurt","Chobani is the brainchild of Hamdi Ulukaya, a Turkish immigrant who recognized the promise held in the yogurt market and risked everything in its pursuit. In 2005, Ulukaya was in the fourth year of running Euphrates Inc., his feta cheese manufacturing startup in Johnstown, N.Y. when he noticed a mailed advertisement for the sale of a Kraft Foods plant. Rebuilt in 1920 after a fire destroyed the original building, the New Berlin, N.Y. facility had aging yogurt production equipment and once employed 55. When Ulukaya toured the 80,000-square-foot building, he decided to buy the plant the very next day.
With an SBA 504 loan, Ulukaya was able to purchase the plant in August 2005. Ulukaya hired five seasoned Kraft employees and spent the rest of the summer covering the outside of the facility with a fresh coat of white paint. Agro Farma started out making private label regular yogurts for other large companies but Ulukaya believed he could make a better yogurt than the competition: We aimed at people who never liked yogurt. We couldnt blame them because what was available was not what the rest of the world was eating.
The recipe for Chobani is thicker and creamier than regular yogurt, with twice the protein and none of the preservatives and artificial flavors. Whats in the yogurt- five live and active cultures, including three probiotics- is as important as whats not, and Agro Farma turned this competitive advantage into the yogurts slogan, Nothing But Good.
Existing Greek yogurt lines were most often sold in expensive specialty stores, so Ulukaya marketed his yogurt brand to a wider customer base through mass distribution channels of grocery store chains. After more than a year developing Chobanis trademark taste, in October 2007 Agro Farmas first shipment included five different flavors- blueberry, peach, strawberry, vanilla and plain- sold to a single Long Island grocery store.
With less than 50 employees when Chobani first hit the shelves, Agro Farma has grown to employ 670 today, providing valuable employment opportunities in Chenango County. Agro Farma now has three full-time shifts, with multiple production lines running 20 hours before stopping for cleaning and maintenance for four hours.
Less than four years after launching, the success of Agro Farma is inspirational, with 1.2 million cases of Chobani made weekly. And in spite of working seven days a week, Ulukaya and his team are enjoying the dynamic journey: A lot of exciting things are happening for the company. If you put your mind to something, put good people around you, and believe, anything is possible. Chobanis story is, for me, if you really try hard, you can do anything, he said.
